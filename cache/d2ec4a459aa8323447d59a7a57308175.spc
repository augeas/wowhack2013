Now the men who will choose his successor demand its full disclosure</p><p>It is known throughout the Vatican as the Relatio (Narration). It is contained in two stiff, unmarked red folders and runs to around 300 pages. Lying in a safe in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace overlooking St Peter's Square, it will be at the forefront of the minds of the 115 cardinals who on Tuesday are to file into the Sistine chapel to start the conclave that elects the next pope.</p><p>In the Relatio are the findings of three cardinal-detectives, appointed last year by ex-pope Benedict XVI to investigate the leaking of documents from his study. The cardinals, headed by a Spanish member of the Opus Dei fellowship, Cardinal Julián Herranz, discovered the main source of the leaks – the pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele.</p><p>But they found a great deal else – and some of it is reportedly extremely compromising. According to one unconfirmed report, they stumbled on a gay sex ring in the Vatican, some of whose members had been blackmailed.</p><p>Already dismayed by the blunders that marred Benedict's papacy, many of the cardinals in Rome to elect his successor are seething with resentment towards the Roman Curia, the intensely secretive and predominantly Italian bureaucracy that administers the Catholic church.</p><p>"The anti-curial – and anti-Italian – feeling is almost palpable," said a source close to their deliberations.</p><p>On the first day of last week's pre-conclave discussions, known as general congregations, three cardinals demanded that Herranz circulate the Relatio. For Massimo Franco, author of a recently published book on the protracted crisis rocking the Vatican, this was more than just prurient curiosity. "The cardinals must vote with a clear view of the situation in the Vatican," he said. "Otherwise, they could be voting for a pope who is accused of wrongdoing in the report. If that comes out afterwards, it would cause mayhem."</p><p>Neither can they avoid that risk simply by voting for a pastoral cardinal – one who is an archbishop in his own country. Most have at least one seat on the committees that oversee the work of the Vatican's various departments and they are frequent visitors to Rome. Innocently or otherwise, one or more could have been linked to events detailed in the Relatio.</p><p>Yet Herranz's reaction was to hold out, apparently signalling that Benedict ordered that the report be kept for his successor. Many in and around the Vatican interpreted his reaction as confirmation of something already becoming apparent – faced with demands for transparency, the departmental satraps of the Curia were closing ranks.</p><p>Indeed, the approach to this conclave has brought about what many in Rome would deem a miracle: an apparent, if temporary, healing of the breach between the Vatican's two most renowned adversaries, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the secretary of state, and his predecessor, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. As a result, a conclave that had been billed as a trial of strength between the two men is shaping up instead as a battle between the "Romans" and invading "Barbarians".</p><p>The first group includes the power-brokers in the Vatican and their allies, many of whom are Italians; the second faction, bent on shaking the Curia to its foundations, is led by cardinals from the United States and Germany.</p><p>But to see it as a contest between conservatives and liberals would be a mistake: after eight years of Benedict XVI and 27 of John Paul II, there are precious few liberals among the cardinals.</p><p>The most obvious sign of the Barbarians' drive for greater transparency was visible last week on the Janiculum, the hill south of the Vatican that at this time of year offers sublime views to the snowy Apennines. In the North American college, the US cardinals attending the general congregations gave daily media briefings in which they managed to shed light on the process without breaking their duty of confidentiality or contradicting the official account of the pope's spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi.</p><p>But on Wednesday they were made to shut up in a move that had as much to do with the looming face-off in the Sistine chapel as with media relations. The pretext was a report in the Italian newspaper <em>La Stampa</em> on the previous day's proceedings that certainly did not come from the Americans' press conferences.</p><p>Initial skirmishing, then, went to the Romans. But the battle itself has yet to be fought, even if there are indications already of who initially will champion each side. The choices are deceptive. The Romans have, for the moment, put their faith in a cardinal who is neither Italian nor curial: the archbishop of São Paulo, Odilo Scherer. Though an "out-of-towner", Scherer is well versed in the ways of the Vatican. The extent of the curial insiders' trust in him is shown by his appointment to the commission that oversees the Vatican bank. Meanwhile, the Barbarians' hopes have coalesced around an Italian, Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan. A disciple, like Benedict, of the Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, Scola is intimately linked to the conservative fellowship Communion and Liberation. Temperamentally, though, he is unlike the retiring Benedict and could vigorously wield the new broom the Barbarians would like to see sweep through the Vatican. He is handicapped by his association with Communion and Liberation, which has recently been tarnished by a corruption scandal in Lombardy, the region around Milan. And, according to someone present, Scola made a speech to the general congregation that was felt to be rather too electioneering.</p><p>The Barbarians have two advantages. One is money; the Americans and Germans between them provide much of the cash that keeps the Vatican afloat. The other is the US contingent's apparent unity of purpose.</p><p>The Romans, on the other hand, seem to have maths on their side. Of the 115 cardinal-electors, 39 hold – or have held – top curial positions. Another nine are Italians outside the Vatican. Some do not share the Curia's instinctive aversion to transparency, but there are others in the field who do. It is among the "floating voters" of the emerging countries that the deciding votes are likely to be cast.</p><p>"The Curia feels itself to be very strong," said Massimo Franco. "Under threat, but strong."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vatican">Vatican</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism">Catholicism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi">Pope Benedict XVI</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity">Christianity</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnhooper">John Hooper</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There were 21 teachers with no teaching qualifications in the 17 free schools that responded to a government census. Almost half (47%) of the schools had at least one unqualified teacher.</p><p>Pimlico Primary free school in Westminster, which is due to open in September, has appointed a headteacher who is only now receiving teacher training. Annaliese Briggs, a former thinktank director who advised the coalition government on its national primary curriculum, is the designated head for the new school, which is sponsored by Future, a charity founded by<a href="http://" title=""> John Nash, the Tory donor and former venture capitalist appointed schools minister in January</a>.</p><p>It is understood that Briggs, an English literature graduate from Queen Mary, University of London, and a former deputy director of the right-wing thinktank Civitas, is being trained in Wandsworth in preparation for the beginning of the next school year. She has already said that she will ignore the national curriculum and teach lessons "inspired by the tried and tested methods of ED Hirsch Jr", the controversial American academic behind what he calls "content-rich" learning.</p><p>One local teacher, who did not want to be named, said he was astonished that such an inexperienced candidate had been selected. . "It seems extraordinary that having experience and teaching qualifications are no longer prerequisites to running a school," he said. Even a young headteacher is normally expected to have six years of teaching experience before they are entrusted with the task of leading a school.</p><p>The education secretary, Michael Gove, announced in 2010 that free schools – which are outside the control of local authorities but funded by the state – would be allowed greater leeway over appointments. Last summer he extended such freedoms to the country's 1,500 academies, claiming that removal of the requirement for staff to have qualified teacher status (QTS) would replicate the "dynamism" that he believes is found in private schools.</p><p>The shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, responding to the school census figures – which were collected in November 2011 – said he would reverse the policy if Labour was in power. "Parents will be shocked to learn that this government changed the rules and we now have unqualified teachers in state schools. This wouldn't happen under Labour – we would ensure teachers are qualified," said Twigg.</p><p>"We need to strengthen, not undermine, the quality and professionalism of teaching. Ministers should reverse this decision so that all young people get the qualified teachers they deserve."</p><p>Leaders of the teaching unions believe the policy is part of a "deskilling" of the profession. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, the largest teachers' union, said the latest figures were an insult to teachers. "This information is just a manifestation of the fundamentally flawed policies of a coalition government that believes it is acceptable that schools should be able to employ leaders and teachers who do not have qualified teacher status," she said.</p><p>"Parents and the public should be deeply concerned that they can no longer have confidence that when children and young people go to school they are being taught by a qualified teacher.</p><p>"If anyone suggested that doctors could be unqualified and allowed to treat patients, everyone would be rightly horrified. Why is the same concern not extended to the education of our children and young people?"</p><p>The row comes as the first Ofsted reports into standards in free schools are published. Batley grammar school in West Yorkshire and Sandbach school in Cheshire were both found to "require improvement". They were said to be letting their pupils down across a range of subjects, particularly English. Staff at Sandbach school were told they had an "inflated view" of their performance.</p><p>Jo Saxton, director of education for Pimlico Primary's sponsor Future, said: "All our staff are carefully selected to ensure the ideal balance between excellent subject knowledge, effective teaching and the ability to engage all pupils."</p><p>A Department for Education spokesman said: "We have given free schools and academies the same freedoms the best independent schools enjoy to hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists so they can inspire their pupils.</p><p>"Pimlico Academy's governors and teachers [Pimlico Academy secondary school is also run by Future and will share its site with Pimlico Primary] took a failing secondary and increased its Ofsted rating to 'outstanding' in record time. Headteachers and governors at places like Pimlico know their schools best and we trust them to recruit the right staff."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/free-schools">Free schools</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools">Schools</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove">Michael Gove</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london">London</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-boffey">Daniel Boffey</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Critics of the socialist government have already complained that officials have violated the constitution by swearing in vice-president Nicolás Maduro as acting leader on Friday night.</p><p>Some people have speculated that Venezuela will not be ready to organise the vote in time, but elections council chief Tibisay Lucena said the country's electronic voting system was fully prepared.</p><p>Lucena announced the date on state television, appearing in a small inset as the main picture showed people filing past Chávez's coffin at the military academy in Caracas, where his body has lain in state since Wednesday.</p><p>Chávez's boisterous, passionate state funeral on Friday often felt like a political rally for his anointed successor, Maduro, who eulogised him by pledging eternal loyalty and vowing Chávez's movement will never be defeated. Maduro is expected to become the candidate of Chávez's socialist party.</p><p>Ramón Guillermo Aveledo, coordinator of the opposition coalition, immediately followed the election announcement by offering his bloc's presidential candidacy to Henrique Capriles, the governor of Miranda state who lost to Chávez in October.</p><p>Mariana Bacalao, a professor of public opinion at the Universidad Central de Venezuela, said the passion on both sides just hours after Chávez's funeral raised fears of far worse to come in the weeks ahead.</p><p>"You can expect during the campaign that these rages will be unleashed," she said.</p><p>In his speech after his swearing-in, Maduro took shots at the United States, the media, international capitalism and domestic opponents he often depicted as treacherous. He claimed the allegiance of Venezuela's army, referring to them as the "armed forces of Chávez," despite the constitution barring the military from taking sides in politics.</p><p>The opposition has denounced the transition as an unconstitutional power grab, and Capriles said his side was studying its strategy for the vote, which will be held in the shadow of the government's efforts to immortalize Chávez. Since his death, the former paratrooper has been compared to Jesus and early 19th century Venezuelan liberator Simón Bolívar, and the government announced that his body would be embalmed and put on eternal display.</p><p>Observers voiced mounting concern about the deep political divide gripping Venezuela, with half of it in a near frenzy of adulation and the other feeling targeted.</p><p>"Everything that happened yesterday (with the funeral and Maduro's speech) are outward signs of a fascistic aesthetic, complete with armbands," said Vicente González de la Vega, a professor of law at Caracas's Universidad Metropolitana. "It is the cult of the adored leader, an escape from reality ... they are trying to impose on the rest of the country a new, pagan religion."</p><p>He said the ruling party was playing with fire with its strong nationalistic rhetoric and the implication that a vote against Maduro was somehow subversive.</p><p>Capriles, too, has used emotionally charged language in his public comments. On Friday he denounced Maduro as a shameless liar who had not been elected by the people, and condescendingly referred to him as "boy."</p><p>Opposition figures have said they are concerned about the election's fairness, particularly given the public vows of allegiance to Chávez from senior military officials. Capriles lost to Chávez in elections on 7 October last year, but he garnered 45% of the vote, which was the most anyone had ever won against the late president.</p><p>A boycott of 2005 legislative elections was widely seen as disastrous for the opposition, letting Chávez's supporters win all 167 seats and allowing him to govern unimpeded by any legislative rivals.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hugo-chavez">Hugo Chávez</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas">Americas</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now he's told the world – and his fellow activists – that he was wrong. So why did he change his mind? And does he have any friends left?</p><p>What was that line in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies" title=""><em>Lord of the Flies</em></a>? When Roger decides to kill Piggy? He makes that irreversible transgression with something like "a sense of delirious abandonment". <a href="http://www.marklynas.org/" title="">Mark Lynas</a> couldn't quite remember, but that's exactly how he felt as he walked on to the stage, in the mid-morning of 3 January, to make his dramatic speech. The night before he'd paced among the farmers and agriculture experts who would be his audience, thinking: "These people have no idea what I'm going to say." They were probably expecting to be bored and annoyed by the appearance of this raving eco-warrior. They didn't know that he'd taken the decision to stand in front of the people who were once his enemy – and confess.</p><p>Back in the mid-90s he'd belonged to a "radical cell" of the anarchist, anti-capitalist environmental movement. He was influential – a&nbsp;co-founder of the magazine <a href="http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/" title=""><em>Corporate Watch</em></a> who'd written the first article about the evils of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gm" title="">Genetically Modified Organisms</a> [GMOs] and <a href="http://www.monsanto.com" title="">Monsanto</a>, the multinational biotech company whose work with GMOs was to become notorious. He was a law breaker. He'd pile into vans with gangs of up to 30 people and spend nights slashing GM crops with machetes. He was angry. He believed that the kind of people who'd attend the <a href="http://www.ofc.org.uk/" title="">Oxford Farming Conference</a> were ruining the world with greed. And now he was preparing to stand under spotlights and bow his head before them. He'd been nervous about it for days. He was scared that by the time his speech was over he wouldn't have any friends left at all.</p><p>Once the crowd's mannered applause had died down, he began. "My lords, ladies and gentlemen. I want to start with some apologies, which I believe are most appropriate to this audience. For the record, here and upfront, I apologise for having spent several years ripping up GM crops. I'm also sorry that I helped to start the anti-GM movement back in the mid-1990s and that I thereby assisted in demonising an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment. As an environmentalist, and someone who believes that everyone in this world has a right to a healthy and nutritious diet of their choosing, I could not have chosen a more counter-productive path. I now regret it completely."</p><p>Fifty minutes later, the audience reacted with what he describes as "shocked applause". His website, on which he'd posted the text of <a href="http://www.marklynas.org/2013/01/lecture-to-oxford-farming-conference-3-january-2013/" title="">his speech</a>, crashed, unable to cope with the demand. He watched, on Twitter, as reaction spread around the world: Portugal, Spain, Chile, Argentina… Millions, he thinks, have now seen it. "It was a complete demolition, not just of anti-GMO but of the whole organic thing," he says. "For a lot of people, it was an 'Oh fuck' moment. They realised they'd been lied to, at a very profound level, by the very people they'd trusted." And what of his worst fear, that he wouldn't have any friends left at all? "Well," he smiles sadly. "That's probably what happened."</p><p>Lynas, 39, lives in a modern terrace in a&nbsp;suburb of Oxford with his wife Maria, his puppy Scout and his children Tom, eight, and Rosa, six. He's handsome and fashionably presented, but in a strangely featureless way, like one of those members of Coldplay whose name nobody can remember. He gives me a cup of tea and leads me down towards his shed, with its sunken sofa, dusty curtains and shelves of sun-bleached books. He's worried about the interview and peppered me with questions beforehand: who was my editor? How many words would it be? Who was the photographer? Why did I&nbsp;want to write it? His anxiety is not surprising. Lynas's speech made the news internationally and, along with it, "all the hate started coming through". He found himself accused of being in the pay of Monsanto which, he says, "shows that people think I have no integrity and look at me with complete contempt".</p><p>In the days when his anger came from the opposite direction, Lynas was a member of an organisation that was "loosely called" <a href="http://earthfirst.org.uk" title="">Earth First!</a> It told a dramatic story about the world, in which the forces of industrialism were conspiring to bring about "environmental apocalypse. Big corporations and capitalism in general were destroying the earth." Theirs was a plucky struggle against the monstrous machines of profit. "We were the protectors of the land and the inheritors of the natural forces," he says. "We were the pixies."</p><p>Lynas first heard about the notion of genetically modifying crops in a Brighton squat in early 1996, at a meeting of about six activists that was lead by Jim Thomas, a campaigns director for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/" title="">Greenpeace</a>. "He really opened my eyes to the awfulness of what Monsanto seemed to be doing," he says. "Something unnatural was being done to our food supply. Big corporations were using more chemicals so that they could take over the food chain." It inspired him to write his <em>Corporate Watch</em> story that was "the first on Monsanto, as far as I&nbsp;know". By the time of Earth First!'s next gathering, GMOs had "become the next big thing". Lynas lead the early workshops that spread the message further. "The people who consider themselves leaders in the anti-GM movement today, I trained them."</p><p>By 1997 his anger had turned to action, and the first "decontamination actions" to destroy experimental GM crops took place. "We'd head out in a van with gardening tools, dark clothes, some cash and no ID." Arriving at around 2am, between 20 and 30 of them would work until dawn, "just going along the line", destroying the plants.</p><p>It wasn't always this straightforward. One night while he was slashing through maize with a machete somewhere in the east of England, Lynas saw flashing lights and heard the barking of dogs. He dropped into the dirt and held still. "For some reason the police went right past me," he says. "I got out of there. I&nbsp;found my way through some woods to the train station. A lot of the others were attacked by dogs and arrested. It was quite scary. In an odd way, I'm quite law abiding. You know, I&nbsp;wear glasses. I don't want to get hit in the face with a&nbsp;truncheon. I'm not really into confrontational situations at all." Lynas played a&nbsp;crucial role at a&nbsp;sit-in, on 29 April 1998, at Monsanto's offices in High Wycombe. "I cased the joint, printed the leaflets and hired the buses," he says.</p><p>It was around this time, however, that Lynas began to experience the first mild cramps of rebellion. He'd begun to notice a widespread denial in the people around him. The more he recognised it, the more it felt like hypocrisy. "Everyone thought of themselves as being tolerant and open-minded," he says. "But if you said something critical about them, you'd be in quite serious trouble." Trouble? "I don't think anyone would've attacked you physically. But you'd go back to your worst days at school, just feeling like the child that everyone hated. I don't really thrive in that sort of bully-boy atmosphere."</p><p>The movement deluded itself about its non-hierarchical nature. It didn't have leaders or elections because, to them, democracy was a lie. "But there <em>were</em> leaders – of which I&nbsp;definitely wasn't one – and everyone else was the sheep, the cannon fodder. The people who could rabble-rouse and were the most radical would rise to the top." The irony of all this was that Earth First! became acutely hierarchical, and in the worst possible way, "because the hierarchy is nontransparent".</p><p>A critical fracture between Lynas and his movement occurred after <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/may/01/mayday.immigrationpolicy" title="">London's 2000 May Day riots</a>, which he helped organise. A&nbsp;branch of McDonald's was attacked, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohican, and the Cenotaph was graffitied. At a meeting of key individuals in a north London pub that followed "everyone was saying: 'This is great'," he remembers. "'We've shown the corporate media!'" Lynas, however, didn't agree. "I thought it was a disaster. Everything we'd been trying to achieve was undermined by all the violence and window smashing. It just alienated people. I thought I'd be honest about it. Everyone looked at me in complete horror, shock and contempt." How did that feel? "Deeply hostile, and deeply limiting, actually. Tolerance and open-mindedness were qualities that people paid lip service to but were not really valued. That was one of the last meetings I went to."</p><p>Lynas had an unusual childhood, being born in Fiji and schooled for three years in Peru. His father was a scientist – a geologist who did mapping for the government – and yet was politically assertive enough to emigrate to Spain in the mid-1980s because of Margaret Thatcher. Lynas remembers Nicaraguan folk bands staying as house guests. Today, his parents live in North Wales. "They have a&nbsp;little organic farm. Post-organic, really. My dad's with me in arguing the need for biological solutions, like GM, to reduce chemical use."</p><p>Lynas's metamorphosis gathered real pace when he started work on his 2004 book<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/apr/24/scienceandnature.highereducation" title=""> <em>High Tide</em></a>. It concerned the consequences of manmade climate change and involved him touring the continents seeking out its effects. This was a cause he was happy to be swept into: climate change made a&nbsp;perfect subplot for his grand narrative about the world of evil capitalism ruining nature. But this new episode introduced a curious character – a nerdy stranger who would go on to corrupt the plot of his life entirely. "I didn't want my book to be just a&nbsp;series of anecdotes," he explains, "so I began researching the science. And I fell in love with it. I realised that science offers a window into truth that nothing else can."</p><p>His embrace of evidence-based knowledge caused a problem. Many of his beliefs about GMOs were predicated on an extravagant dismissal of the scientific consensus. "The whole GM thing had been about criticising scientists, saying they were corrupt, corporate shills," he says. "And we definitely believed all those things. But I realised everything we were doing was deeply reductionist, basically saying: 'Scientists should shut down their labs and go and work in Tesco.' It was a kind of counter-enlightenment. People against a process."</p><p>Lynas lived the next few years in a state of weird, gigantic dissonance. A 2005 column for the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/" title=""><em>New Statesman</em></a>, which expressed doubt about traditional anti-nuclear arguments, prompted activists that he knew to "write in, saying I'd ruined their lives". His next book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Six-Degrees-Future-Hotter-Planet/dp/0007209053" title=""><em>Six Degrees: Our Future in a Hotter Planet</em></a>, won 2008's prestigious Royal Society prize for science writing. And yet he was still existing between narratives in a way that, inevitably, became excruciating. The last piece of "GM crap" he wrote was for the<em> </em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marklynas" title=""><em>Guardian</em></a>, the year of his award. "I knew at the time I didn't believe it," he says. "I wrote it in an internet café. I thought: 'God, I really need to have some sources for these things.' Then I thought: 'Fuck it.' I'd just had this stamp of approval from the scientific community. And then I'm writing this completely unscientific and hopelessly unintellectual thing. How embarrassing can you get?"</p><p>In November 2010 he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/what-the-green-movement-got-wrong" title=""><em>What the Green Movement Got Wrong</em></a>, and a live debate that followed. In the shows he defended GMOs and nuclear power. Afterwards, he says, a&nbsp;member of Greenpeace "was that close to me, shouting in my face. I literally left the studio with a&nbsp;bag over my head." Close friends felt betrayed. "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/georgemonbiot" title="">George Monbiot</a> sent me a really devastating email." He also fell out with the person who'd been best man at his wedding. "We'd been friends for 10 years. We still have no relationship."</p><p>Lynas also experienced a more subtle realignment in his worldview. He'd been used to seeing the Green movement as the brave, scrappy underdogs. But the more he looked, the more little David began to resemble Goliath. "Just take the numbers," he says. "Greenpeace, the whole international group, is a $150m outfit [in fact, figures provided by Greenpeace show global income in 2011 as $313.4m]. Bigger than the <a href="http://www.wto.org/" title="">World Trade Organisation</a>, and much more influential in terms of determining how people think." For Lynas, the modern Green movement is one of undeniable force. It's changed the world "sometimes for the better", but not always. "The anti-nuclear movement is partly responsible for global warming," he says. "Everywhere, pretty much, where a nuclear plant was cancelled, a&nbsp;coal plant was built instead, and that's because of the anti-nuclear movement. The environmental movement has been very successful in regulating GM out of existence in some parts of the world."</p><p>Lynas has been very critical of Greenpeace's policy towards a GM crop that's become totemic among campaigners. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/feb/02/genetic-modification-breakthrough-golden-rice" title="">Golden rice</a> is a&nbsp;crop that's been modified, by the insertion of the genes for the chemical beta-carotene, in an attempt to make it provide more vitamin A. "Vitamin-A deficiency is one of the leading causes of death in southeast Asia," says Lynas. "It's led to blindness and the death of about a quarter of a million people a&nbsp;year." Yet campaigners, including Greenpeace, lobbied against it.</p><p>Greenpeace insists golden rice is a "waste of money" and an "ineffective tool…&nbsp;[that] is also environmentally irresponsible, poses risks to human health and compromises food security". For Lynas, its stance is "just superstition. There are tens of thousands of kids who are dead who wouldn't be dead otherwise. I don't see how you could put this any other way. Imagine if Monsanto had been culpable in the deaths of tens of thousands of children! It would be all over the <em>Guardian</em>." (Lynas later made the partial concession that "there have been technical hold-ups in the golden rice project, and you can't solely blame Greenpeace for the overregulation that is applied to GMOs".)</p><p>Since his Oxford Farming Conference speech, some have launched attacks on Lynas's interpretation of the science. But the rebellion against his rebellion has also been personal. Some former associates have questioned his claim to have been an influential figure. Jim Thomas, the former Greenpeace activist who first told Lynas about GMOs and lived with him for a few months, says: "Lynas was a player, but not a very important player, and for a very short period of time. Maybe in his mind he was important, but I&nbsp;don't think anybody else saw him that way." Ultimately, says Thomas, "I feel saddened by the whole thing. He's built a very successful career on the back of portraying people who were his friends as unthinking."</p><p>Lynas counters that he's unable to defend himself from charges he's exaggerated his role due the illegality of the acts he and his associates were complicit in. "People don't want their names mentioned," he says. But the attacks hurt. "I've been complaining to my wife, but she said: 'Don't feel sorry for yourself. You've insulted people at the deepest level of their values. You've done something completely wounding to their very sense of self.' This was a&nbsp;life's work for people I was close to, and as far as they're concerned I've tried to destroy it."</p><p>As for Lynas's life's mission, the change has been everything and nothing. He might not be battling against corporations any more, but he still feels "as if I'm changing the world for the better in my own small way".</p><p>Nevertheless, he speaks of the betrayal and subsequent loss of his friends as a tragedy – "but tragic in the Shakespearean sense that you could see it coming". Indeed, how much of his metamorphosis was inevitable? Can his mutiny really constitute a moral treachery when so much of it seemed to happen <em>to</em> him? He was, after all, born into a family of independent spirit, to a scientist father, who was also a political radical who deified the environment. Emotional rebellion became empirical rebellion, when a book project forced him from the "echo chamber" of Earth First!.</p><p>And then, what should he do? Try to live with it all, hounded by the dissonance of his contradictions? Or speak up and brave whatever damage might be caused? His opponents, who mutter about his "successful career", despite his modest circumstances, deny the complexity of human motivation. Nobody is pure. But few do as he has done, and have the courage to doubt themselves with as much vigour as they've previously doubted others.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gm">GM</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/food-science">Food science</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/food">Food</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/farming">Farming</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/activism">Activism</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/will-storr">Will Storr</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By sending a letter to party leaders that rejects all "press-led" compromises, campaigners hope to initiate an endgame in protracted wrangles over Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations.</p><p>The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, and the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, are due to meet the prime minister early this week to urge him to strengthen new regulations, while the many victims of press intrusion who contributed to the Leveson inquiry – including Tessa Jowell, the McCanns, Sienna Miller, Anne Diamond, the Dowlers, Max Mosley and JK Rowling – have signed a letter to Oliver Letwin, the minister in charge of the issue, calling for an immediate end to talks with editors so that parliament can have its say before the end of the month.</p><p>Speaking at a public event in Covent Garden, London, on Friday, Clegg agreed that the coming week would be "crucial" and argued for a legal basis to any new rules. He stopped short, however, of rejecting a royal charter.</p><p>Jacqui Hames, a former <em>Crimewatch</em> presenter and Met police detective, told the <em>Observer</em> she felt a growing sense of unease. "We all hoped the report might mark a new era of transparency in relations between government and the press, but now that hope has evaporated," she said, adding that news that one of the advisers helping to design a self-regulatory body is former <em>Sun</em> political editor Trevor Kavanagh did not inspire confidence either.</p><p>"Whatever happened to the press wanting to show that they have changed and won't disappear back down the slippery slope?" she said.</p><p>The victims' letter, sent out this weekend by their solicitor, Dominic Crossley, has been copied to David Cameron, Clegg and Miliband.</p><p>"To propose anything less than Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations would be to demonstrate the press's continued malign influence over government," writes Crossley.</p><p>By the time leaders of the three main parties meet campaigners on behalf of the victims, it is hoped that every MP will have received a copy of Crossley's arguments, along with a covering letter in support from an MP on their own political benches.</p><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/mar/06/authors-party-leaders-libel-reforms" title="">A House of Lords amendment to the defamation bill</a>, introduced by Labour peer Lord Puttnam, aims to bring in press regulation, despite Cameron's opposition to legislation. The amended bill was due to return to the Commons at the end of the week, but Cameron is expected to block it to prevent a likely government defeat. Such a manoeuvre will not only incense supporters of press reform, but dismay free speech campaigners on both sides of the house who have been banking on key reforms contained in the body of the bill.</p><p>Hacked Off campaigners argue that Puttnam's additions to the bill are quite suitable if it is designed to protect freedom of expression. They want Cameron to put it back on the House of Commons slate and claim that the amendment offers a new system of redress for poorer victims of the press, while necessary reforms to libel law will only protect the rich.</p><p>Crossbench peer Lord Skidelsky has also put down Leveson-inspired amendments to an enterprise reform bill, due to reach the report stage next week. These reforms, again unrelated to the "host" bill, would introduce statutory arbitration of the press and create a body to oversee any voluntary regulator. Further tinkering with upcoming bills, such as the Crimes and Courts Bill, due to be debated on Wednesday, has also been mooted.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/press-intrusion">Press intrusion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/privacy">Privacy & the media</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-report">Leveson report</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing">Newspapers & magazines</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers">Newspapers</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-inquiry">Leveson inquiry</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vanessathorpe">Vanessa Thorpe</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Instead of helping vulnerable victims who are trapped into forms of slavery after being trafficked from overseas, the legal system prosecutes many for immigration offences.</p><p>The major study by the Centre for Social Justice, which will be published on Monday, says that political indifference and ignorance alongside a leadership vacuum in Whitehall has meant that the country that led the way in abolishing slavery in the 19th century is now a "shameful shadow" of its former self as the practice makes a comeback in a contemporary guise.</p><p>To restore Britain's reputation on the issue, the centre's report outlines more than 80 recommendations, including the appointment of an independent anti-slavery commissioner, to ensure proper political focus and new legislation to better protect victims.</p><p>Researchers were stunned at the lack of awareness of the problem among frontline officials whose job it was to identify and help trafficked victims. "We have encountered unacceptable levels of ignorance and misidentification of victims among the police, social services, the UKBA [UK Border Agency], the judicial system and others," said the report.</p><p>Social workers, it added, were "not equipped" to identify victims of modern slavery. One charity described how it was normal for just a couple of hands to be raised when a room holding 40 social workers was asked if anyone knew about the national referral mechanism, the government's system for identifying and protecting suspected trafficking victims.</p><p>Police, too, were found wanting, with officers often choosing to arrest trafficking victims instead of protecting them. One deputy chief constable recalled the case of a girl who had managed to escape from a brothel and flee to a police station where she described how she had been trafficked. "She had no passport. Under these confusing circumstances, we chose to arrest her for being an illegal immigrant," he said.</p><p>A detective inspector admitted that there was no political encouragement to tackle slavery. "Human trafficking is not a performance indicator for police. Until it is, there is more incentive to investigate a shed burglar," he said.</p><p>Another officer told researchers: "So what do we do when we find them? We charge them. We nick them. Is that the best victim care?"</p><p>Although the government has requested that each force have a senior officer responsible for human trafficking, only half of the 33 forces that responded had appointed one. In addition, 90% of police officers had ignored an online educational course designed to raise awareness of modern slavery.</p><p>Entitled <em>It Happens Here</em>, the CSJ study collated evidence of exploitation of foreign adults and children as well as British citizens, in factories, fields, construction sites, brothels and houses. It identified more than 1,000 cases, but cautioned that official figures remain "a pale reflection of the true size of the problem". Christian Guy, managing director of the centre, said it was appalling that many of those who fall into modern-day slavery were themselves considered criminals.</p><p>The 224-page report was written after an 18-month investigation during which a team of experts interviewed hundreds of witnesses, including journalists from the <em>Observer. </em>Guy said: "We have been shocked by many of our findings. A leadership vacuum at the heart of Westminster; a messy legislative framework; frontline professionals – however well meaning and brilliant in some areas – forced to swim against a tide of indifference if they wanted to fight this crime; official bodies failing in their duty of care, with little idea about the scale of the problem.</p><p>"Our research has uncovered a shocking underworld in which children and adults, many of them UK citizens, have been forced into lives of utter degradation. Yet the authorities are either failing to understand the nature of this abuse or turning a blind eye to its existence."</p><p>The investigation found large numbers of people were being used for forced criminality, including benefit fraud, organised begging, and forced pickpocketing and drug cultivation, the last frequently involving young Vietnamese people on cannabis farms. Yet experts identified a pervading mentality at the UKBA that victims had often made a choice to be involved in such criminality, rather than the fact that they were being exploited.</p><p>Large numbers of incidents of British girls being trafficked within the UK were also found, mainly for sexual exploitation. In one case a girl taken into captivity by a group of men was allegedly raped 90 times over the course of a weekend.</p><p>Even when rescued from their abusers, the report lamented that the state regularly failed to keep victims safe. The centre cites figures that 60% of children placed in local authority care and believed to have been trafficked then go missing – often because they are so terrified of their traffickers that they take the first opportunity to go back.</p><p>In one case which was described to the CSJ, a boy who had been trafficked into the UK who was taken into care disappeared on a visit to the dentist, climbing out of a window to return to his abuser.</p><p>"Elements of control in these cases can be subtle and difficult to identify; this control frequently takes the form of sexual and other forms of violence, physical or emotional abuse, threats of violence towards family members," said the report.</p><p>Andrew Wallis, chief executive of the anti-trafficking charity Unseen, who worked on the report, said: "We simply cannot be satisfied with our current efforts to prevent this vile trade from happening. We have allowed human beings in the UK to be bought and sold as mere commodities for profit, gain or gratification. How on earth have we arrived at a place where there is no ambition or leadership to stamp out this appalling crime?"</p><p>The CSJ study calls on parliament to pass new anti-slavery legislation aimed at requiring companies with turnovers above £100m a year to publicly disclose the efforts they are making to ensure that their supply and product chains and business practices are free from modern slavery. Similar legislation is in force in California, where it has proved successful in cutting abuse.</p><p>The report also hopes to tackle one of the myths associated with human trafficking, namely that it is an international crime overwhelmingly affecting women and children. Of the 2,077 potential victims of modern slavery identified by the UK Human Trafficking Centre in 2011, 40% were men.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-trafficking">Human trafficking</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/slavery">Slavery</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/prostitution">Prostitution</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police">Police</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-care">Social care</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm">Toby Helm</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktownsend">Mark Townsend</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She told the <em>Observer</em>: "The very first sentence of the Liberal Democrats' constitution states that they exist to build a 'fair, free, and open society'. The vote in favour of secret courts is an attack on the heart and soul of the party."</p><p>In her resignation statement, Rose said: "The right to a fair hearing, and the right to open justice, are among the most fundamental of all our basic constitutional rights. I just cannot see what purpose is served by the party, if it is prepared to support the bill. I have therefore decided, with great regret, to resign my party membership."</p><p>The Lib Dem leadership's decision to back plans to extend the use of secret hearings in civil courts, where matters of national security are at stake, has divided the party. In last week's Commons vote on the security and justice bill, in which Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister Clegg ordered his MPs to back the controversial measures, party president Tim Farron and deputy leader Simon Hughes were among those who voted in favour of Labour amendments, which included the introduction of a public interest test for secret courts.</p><p>Ministers eventually defeated two attempts by Labour and coalition rebels to introduce extra safeguards into plans to allow civil courts to sit in secret, a move critics warn threatens the rule of law and could allow the security services to cover up involvement in abuse and torture.</p><p>Fury over the controversial measures will take centre stage at the Lib Dems' spring conference in Brighton, where Clegg will face a full-throttled attack after opponents within his party won the right to a debate on the issue.</p><p>The deputy prime minister attempted to reason with his critics, who claim Clegg has "betrayed" the founding principles of the party. He told a stormy question-and-answer session that he was unable to block the legislation for secret courts and that he believed his parliamentary party had dealt with the worst excesses of the bill going through parliament.</p><p>Clegg said: "Please don't allege that this government, with Liberal Democrats in it, is doing something abhorrently illiberal, which we are not."</p><p>Jo Shaw, a member of the party and a lawyer who has been leading opposition to the secret courts legislation, said Clegg had failed to reassure his party colleagues and she expected the conference to vote against the leadership on Sundaytoday.</p><p>She said: "These measures go against the fundamentals beliefs of Liberal Democrats." Julian Huppert MP, one of the Lib Dems who voted against the bill in the Commons last week, said his party's leadership had worked to improve the legislation but that it was still "not enough".</p><p>The failure of most Lib Dem MPs to ignore the party conference's overwhelming opposition to the plans has infuriated Lib Dem members. The <em>Observer</em> understands that several more high-profile supporters are considering resigning from the party.</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of pressure group Liberty said: "When one of the pre-eminent human rights' QCs in the country resigns from the ranks, a leader would be wise to reflect on his direction."</p><p>She added: "Most Liberal Democrats are rightly horrified by the secret courts bill and astonished that the party that once made civil liberties its USP is now exchanging Mill for Kafka."</p><p>Rose has extensive experience of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), which deals with deportation cases that affect issues of national security and constitutes the most secret court in the English legal system. Pivotal cases Rose has been involved in include that of Bisher al-Rawi and other Guantánamo detainees in which they alleged ill-treatment during their detention.</p><p>The case led to a supreme court judgment banning secret hearings, known as closed material procedures (CMPs). That ban led the government to introduce the justice and security bill, which will expand the use of CMPs into civil courts.</p><p>Rose's resignation note added: "I believe that I am the only person who has acted in SIAC for the home secretary, as a special advocate, and for appellants.</p><p>"My conclusion, in common with the overwhelming majority of those who have acted as special advocates, is that CMPs cannot be fairly operated."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/justice-and-security">Justice and security bill</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg">Nick Clegg</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/binyam-mohamed">Binyam Mohamed</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktownsend">Mark Townsend</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-boffey">Daniel Boffey</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The authors, led by ecologist Paul Dolman, reported how they used infrared thermal imaging equipment at night to count roe and muntjac deer numbers around the Norfolk-Suffolk border. Deer densities were found to be much higher than previously assumed, and because deer eat shrubs and undergrowth and damage habitats of birds including the nightingale they called for a cull of half of the area's 3,500 muntjac deer and 60% of its 2,211 roe deer.</p><p>However, it was Dolman's subsequent remarks – which enlarged on these suggestions – at a press conference on Thursday that triggered the particular fury of gamekeepers. Dolman was reported as saying his team's research suggested that up to 750,000 deer would have to be culled to prevent widespread ecological damage.</p><p>"I didn't say that," Dolman told the <em>Observer</em>. "I just used those figures as hypothetical examples. In fact, we don't know how many deer there are in this country and that is the real problem that I was trying to get over. We cannot manage deer or control the damage they do until we get a proper estimate of their numbers. That is the real thrust of our research. We have found that our knowledge of deer population densities is much poorer than we previously thought."</p><p>In particular, Dolman's research indicates that in low-level landscapes, such as those around the Norfolk-Suffolk border, deer numbers have been underestimated. "We are culling them, but not in sufficient numbers," he said. His group's prime concern was roe and muntjac deer, while deer stalking is primarily concerned with red deer and occurs principally in the Scottish Highlands.</p><p>This point is acknowledged by Dolman. "Red deer still cause damage to farm and woodland. However, they also live in many areas where they are stalked as a business and so other commercial considerations must be taken into account." In other words, the extensive cull suggested by the East Anglia research is not necessarily appropriate for the Highlands, where income is generated by overseas businessmen who pay to hunt deer.</p><p>The qualification is unlikely to soothe the feelings of Scotland's gamekeepers. They have already been incensed by recent decisions by the Scottish government, which wants to increase significantly the amount of land covered with new forests in the Highlands, a move gamekeepers say will only be possible by using land currently ruled by the red deer. Calls for culling are only going to worsen a grim situation, they add.</p><p>Deer stalking is beleaguered, gamekeepers argue. "A national scandal is playing out on Scotland's hills," states a new association report called "The economic importance of red deer to Scotland's rural economy". It argues that the country's red deer population has already reached a dangerously low level. The study indicates that in Sutherland, in the far north of Scotland, deer-related activities in estates generate income of around £1.6m. By contrast, expenditure on deer management is around £4.7m while wages account for a further £2m. "No public sector business could support such year-on-year losses," the report states.</p><p>The authors point out that any decrease in deer numbers by culling could drive estates out of business. As Fraser states in his introduction: "We are on the point of destroying for ever a precious national resource which attracts nature lovers, walkers and sportsmen to our hills, brings employment to the glens, fine food to our tables and revenue to our nation."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife">Wildlife</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/animals">Animals</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs">Rural affairs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/">Conservation</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robinmckie">Robin McKie</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

May said: "We're at our strongest when anyone and everyone can feel that the Conservative party is for them." The speech, resembling a leader's party conference delivery in its scope and tone, was seen as an attempt to raise her profile at a time when many Tories are losing faith in Cameron's ability to remain as leader beyond the next election.</p><p>In a further worrying development for the coalition – and for Labour – the poll shows Nigel Farage's Ukip at 17%, more than double the Lib Dems' rating, as the populist anti-EU party siphons off support from both the Tories, who are down 2% on 27% compared with a fortnight ago, and Labour, down 2% on 39%.</p><p>Even among Tory voters, only 55% thought the government's economic policies were benefiting the country. Among Lib Dem backers, just 24% thought they were helping to restore the economy.</p><p>Tensions over economic policy surfaced at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, where business secretary Vince Cable – who has called for more borrowing to fund housing and other infrastructure – warned against allowing the Tories to carry on waging an "ideological jihad against public spending and public services".</p><p>Former Liberal Democrat minister Paul Burstow joined those voicing serious doubts, saying it was crucial that the rate of deficit reduction did not inflict "great damage" on the British economy's potential to bounce back to growth.</p><p>"The government has been very focused on deficit reduction quite rightly, but that shouldn't be at the expense of doing everything possible to encourage growth," he said. "There is a growing concern that quantitative easing is not putting real money into the economy and we need to look at what we can do differently to put money into the economy."</p><p>Former leader Paddy Ashdown, who is heading the party's election strategy, said he disagreed with Cable's call for more borrowing, arguing there was no reason to believe it would be a panacea for Britain's economic problems. While Ashdown said he wanted the party to make a habit of being in government, he acknowledged that it was a constant battle "with Tory heartlessness to fight, and tough decisions to take in government".</p><p>The conference was mired in controversy as a motion calling for an emergency debate on economic strategy was rejected.</p><p>Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, grilled about the lack of growth during a stormy question-and-answer session, called for discipline from Liberal Democrats and stressed there was no "magic wand" that would pull the economy round in a hurry.</p><p>Asked by former Lib Dem London mayoral candidate Brian Paddick whether there would be more growth if the Tories were not leading the government, Clegg said there was no easy way to economic success.</p><p>This week Labour will step up pressure over the economy by calling for an urgent review of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, after figures showed net lending had fallen despite the scheme having been in operation for six months. Lending to businesses is down more than overall lending, which Labour believes is a factor in holding back recovery.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a poll conducted in marginal seats by the Tory former deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, based on interviews with more than 19,000 voters in 213 constituencies, showed the Conservatives were on course to lose 93 seats to Labour if an election were held today.</p><p>This is lower than the national swing suggested by headline voting intention polls, partly because Labour is finding it hard to break through in Conservative seats in London and parts of the south.</p><p>It suggested that Labour would win 93 of the 109 most marginal Conservative seats in which it is in second place. The swing to Labour would be biggest in the Thames Estuary, the Midlands and some northern seats, but lower in southern towns and suburbs of London.</p><p>Emphasising that the poll represented a snapshot not a prediction, Ashcroft said: "I don't want to see a Labour majority of four, let alone 84. But I hope this puts the challenge into some sort of perspective. We have a long way to go to hold on to the seats we gained last time, let alone pick up many more. But things are slightly less grim than the headline polls suggest and we have everything to play for."</p><p>A Tory source said the party did not believe the Ashcroft polling accurately represented the state of the parties.</p><p>"Private and public polling repeatedly shows when faced with a straight choice between [Ed] Miliband and Cameron the public choose Cameron," he said. "Historically opposition parties who go on to win are at this stage in the parliament more than 20 points in front. Labour are nowhere near that.</p><p>"One year ago today we were marginally ahead in the polls. A lot can happen in a year. We need to go out there and demonstrate our strengths to electors. We are already outlining things on our side – a reduction of deficit, more private sector jobs and more people in employment."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/polls">Opinion polls</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne">George Osborne</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy">Economic policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron">David Cameron</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/vincentcable">Vince Cable</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/office-for-budget-responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics">Economics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/government-borrowing">Government borrowing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/budget-deficit">Budget deficit</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm">Toby Helm</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-boffey">Daniel Boffey</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But is this ethical?</p><p>The police have a very bright future ahead of them – and not just because they can now look up potential suspects on Google. As they embrace the latest technologies, their work is bound to become easier and more effective, raising thorny questions about privacy, civil liberties, and due process.</p><p>For one, policing is in a good position to profit from "big data". As the costs of recording devices keep falling, it's now possible to spot and react to crimes in real time. Consider a city like Oakland in California. Like many other American cities, today it is covered with hundreds of hidden microphones and sensors, part of a system known as ShotSpotter, which not only alerts the police to the sound of gunshots but also triangulates their location. On verifying that the noises are actual gunshots, a human operator then informs the police.</p><p>It's not hard to imagine ways to improve a system like ShotSpotter. Gunshot-detection systems are, in principle, reactive; they might help to thwart or quickly respond to crime, but they won't root it out. The decreasing costs of computing, considerable advances in sensor technology, and the ability to tap into vast online databases allow us to move from identifying crime as it happens – which is what the ShotSpotter does now – to predicting it before it happens.</p><p>Instead of detecting gunshots, new and smarter systems can focus on detecting the sounds that have preceded gunshots in the past. This is where the techniques and ideologies of big data make another appearance, promising that a greater, deeper analysis of data about past crimes, combined with sophisticated algorithms, can predict – and prevent – future ones. This is a practice known as "predictive policing", and even though it's just a few years old, many tout it as a revolution in how police work is done. It's the epitome of solutionism; there is hardly a better example of how technology and big data can be put to work to solve the problem of crime by simply eliminating crime altogether. It all seems too easy and logical; who wouldn't want to prevent crime before it happens?</p><p>Police in America are particularly excited about what predictive policing – one of <em>Time </em>magazine's best inventions of 2011 – has to offer; Europeans are slowly catching up as well, with Britain in the lead. Take the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which is using software called PredPol. The software analyses years of previously published statistics about property crimes such as burglary and automobile theft, breaks the patrol map into 500 sq ft zones, calculates the historical distribution and frequency of actual crimes across them, and then tells officers which zones to police more vigorously.</p><p>It's much better – and potentially cheaper – to prevent a crime before it happens than to come late and investigate it. So while patrolling officers might not catch a criminal in action, their presence in the right place at the right time still helps to deter criminal activity. Occasionally, though, the police might indeed disrupt an ongoing crime. In June 2012 the Associated Press reported on an LAPD captain who wasn't so sure that sending officers into a grid zone on the edge of his coverage area – following PredPol's recommendation – was such a good idea. His officers, as the captain expected, found nothing; however, when they returned several nights later, they caught someone breaking a window. Score one for PredPol?</p><p>Trials of PredPol and similar software began too recently to speak of any conclusive results. Still, the intermediate results look quite impressive. In Los Angeles, five LAPD divisions that use it in patrolling territory populated by roughly 1.3m people have seen crime decline by 13%. The city of Santa Cruz, which now also uses PredPol, has seen its burglaries decline by nearly 30%. Similar uplifting statistics can be found in many other police departments across America.</p><p>Other powerful systems that are currently being built can also be easily reconfigured to suit more predictive demands. Consider the New York Police Department's latest innovation – the so-called <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/nypd-microsoft-surveillance-system" title="">Domain Awareness System</a> – which syncs the city's 3,000 closed-circuit camera feeds with arrest records, 911 calls, licence plate recognition technology, and radiation detectors. It can monitor a situation in real time and draw on a lot of data to understand what's happening. The leap from here to predicting what might happen is not so great.</p><p>If PredPol's "prediction" sounds familiar, that's because its methods were inspired by those of prominent internet companies. Writing in <em>The Police Chief </em>magazine in 2009, a senior LAPD officer <a href="http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&article_id=1942&issue_id=112009" title="">lauded Amazon's ability</a> to "understand the unique groups in their customer base and to characterise their purchasing patterns", which allows the company "not only to anticipate but also to promote or otherwise shape future behaviour". Thus, just as Amazon's algorithms make it possible to predict what books you are likely to buy next, similar algorithms might tell the police how often – and where – certain crimes might happen again. Ever stolen a bicycle? Then you might also be interested in robbing a grocery store.</p><p>Here we run into the perennial problem of algorithms: their presumed objectivity and quite real lack of transparency. We can't examine Amazon's algorithms; they are completely opaque and have not been subject to outside scrutiny. Amazon claims, perhaps correctly, that secrecy allows it to stay competitive. But can the same logic be applied to policing? If no one can examine the algorithms – which is likely to be the case as predictive-policing software will be built by private companies – we won't know what biases and discriminatory practices are built into them. And algorithms increasingly dominate many other parts of our legal system; for example, they are also used to predict how likely a certain criminal, once on parole or probation, is to kill or be killed. Developed by a University of Pennsylvania professor, this algorithm has been tested in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington DC. Such probabilistic information can then influence sentencing recommendations and bail amounts, so it's hardly trivial.</p><p>But how do we know that the algorithms used for prediction do not reflect the biases of their authors? For example, crime tends to happen in poor and racially diverse areas. Might algorithms – with their presumed objectivity – sanction even greater racial profiling? In most democratic regimes today, police need probable cause – some evidence and not just guesswork – to stop people in the street and search them. But armed with such software, can the police simply say that the algorithms told them to do it? And if so, how will the algorithms testify in court? Techno-utopians will probably overlook such questions and focus on the abstract benefits that algorithmic policing has to offer; techno-sceptics, who start with some basic knowledge of the problems, constraints and biases that already pervade modern policing, will likely be more critical.</p><p>Legal scholar Andrew Guthrie Ferguson has studied predictive policing in detail. Ferguson cautions against putting too much faith in the algorithms and succumbing to information reductionism. "Predictive algorithms are not magic boxes that divine future crime, but instead probability models of future events based on current environmental vulnerabilities," he notes.</p><p>But why do they work? Ferguson points out that there will be future crime not because there was past crime but because "the environmental vulnerability that encouraged the first crime is still unaddressed". When the police, having read their gloomy forecast about yet another planned car theft, see an individual carrying a screwdriver in one of the predicted zones, this might provide reasonable suspicion for a stop. But, as Ferguson notes, if the police arrested the gang responsible for prior crimes the day before, but the model does not yet reflect this information, then prediction should be irrelevant, and the police will need some other reasonable ground for stopping the individual. If they do make the stop, then they shouldn't be able to say in court, "The model told us to." This, however, may not be obvious to the person they have stopped, who has no familiarity with the software and its algorithms.</p><p>Then there's the problem of under-reported crimes. While most homicides are reported, many rapes and home break-ins are not. Even in the absence of such reports, local police still develop ways of knowing when something odd is happening in their neighbourhoods. Predictive policing, on the other hand, might replace such intuitive knowledge with a naive belief in the comprehensive power of statistics. If only data about reported crimes are used to predict future crimes and guide police work, some types of crime might be left unstudied – and thus unpursued.</p><p>What to do about the algorithms then? It is a rare thing to say these days but there is much to learn from the financial sector in this regard. For example, after a couple of disasters caused by algorithmic trading in August 2012, financial authorities in Hong Kong and Australia drafted proposals to establish regular independent audits of the design, development and modification of the computer systems used for algorithmic trading. Thus, just as financial auditors could attest to a company's balance sheet, algorithmic auditors could verify if its algorithms are in order.</p><p>As algorithms are further incorporated into our daily lives – from Google's Autocomplete to PredPol – it seems prudent to subject them to regular investigations by qualified and ideally public-spirited third parties. One advantage of the auditing solution is that it won't require the audited companies publicly to disclose their trade secrets, which has been the principal objection – voiced, of course, by software companies – to increasing the transparency of their algorithms.</p><p>The police are also finding powerful allies in Silicon Valley. Companies such as Facebook have begun using algorithms and historical data to predict which of their users might commit crimes using their services. Here is how it works: Facebook's own predictive systems can flag certain users as suspicious by studying certain behavioural cues: the user only writes messages to others under 18; most of the user's contacts are female; the user is typing keywords like "sex" or "date." Staffers can then examine each case and report users to the police as necessary. Facebook's concern with its own brand here is straightforward: no one should think that the platform is harbouring criminals.</p><p>In 2011 Facebook began using PhotoDNA, a Microsoft service that allows it to scan every uploaded picture and compare it with child-porn images from the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic" title="">FBI's National Crime Information Centre</a>. Since then it has expanded its analysis beyond pictures as well. In mid-2012 <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86B05G20120712" title="">Reuters reported on how Facebook</a>, armed with its predictive algorithms, apprehended a middle-aged man chatting about sex with a 13-year-old girl, arranging to meet her the day after. The police contacted the teen, took over her computer, and caught the man.</p><p>Facebook is at the cutting edge of algorithmic surveillance here: just like police departments that draw on earlier crime statistics, Facebook draws on archives of real chats that preceded real sex assaults. Curiously, Facebook justifies its use of algorithms by claiming that they tend to be less intrusive than humans. "We've never wanted to set up an environment where we have employees looking at private communications, so it's really important that we use technology that has a very low false-positive rate," Facebook's chief of security told Reuters.</p><p>It's difficult to question the application of such methods to catching sexual predators who prey on children (not to mention that Facebook may have little choice here, as current US child-protection laws require online platforms used by teens to be vigilant about predators). But should Facebook be allowed to predict any other crimes? After all, it can easily engage in many other kinds of similar police work: detecting potential drug dealers, identifying potential copyright violators (Facebook already prevents its users from sharing links to many file-sharing sites), and, especially in the wake of the 2011 riots in the UK, predicting the next generation of troublemakers. And as such data becomes available, the temptation to use it becomes almost irresistible.</p><p>That temptation was on full display following the rampage in a Colorado movie theatre in June 2012, when an isolated gunman went on a killing spree, murdering 12 people. A headline that appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>soon after the shooting says it all: "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443570904577546671693245302.html" title="">Can Data Mining Stop the Killing?</a>" It won't take long for this question to be answered in the affirmative.</p><p>In many respects, internet companies are in a much better position to predict crime than police. Where the latter need a warrant to assess someone's private data, the likes of Facebook can look up their users' data whenever they want. From the perspective of police, it might actually be advantageous to have Facebook do all this dirty work, because Facebook's own investigations don't have to go through the court system.</p><p>While Facebook probably feels too financially secure to turn this into a business – it would rather play up its role as a good citizen – smaller companies might not resist the temptation to make a quick buck. In 2011 TomTom, a Dutch satellite-navigation company that has now licensed some of its almighty technology to Apple, found itself in the middle of a privacy scandal when it emerged that it had been selling GPS driving data collected from customers to the police. Privacy advocate Chris Soghoian has likewise documented the easy-to-use "pay-and-wiretap" interfaces that various internet and mobile companies have established for law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Publicly available information is up for grabs too. Thus, police are already studying social-networking sites for signs of unrest, often with the help of private companies. The title of a recent brochure from Accenture urges law enforcement agencies to "tap the power of social media to drive better policing outcomes". Plenty of companies are eager to help. ECM Universe, a start-up from Virginia, US, touts its system, called Rapid Content Analysis for Law Enforcement, which is described as "a social media surveillance solution providing real-time monitoring of Twitter, Facebook, Google groups, and many other communities where users express themselves freely".</p><p>"The solution," notes the ECM brochure, "employs text analytics to correlate threatening language to surveillance subjects, and alert investigators of warning signs." What kind of warning signs? A recent article in the <em>Washington Post </em>notes that ECM Universe helped authorities in Fort Lupton, Colorado, identify a man who was tweeting such menacing things as "kill people" and "burn [expletive] school". This seems straightforward enough but what if it was just "harm people" or "police suck"?</p><p>As companies like ECM Universe accumulate extensive archives of tweets and Facebook updates sent by actual criminals, they will also be able to predict the kinds of non-threatening verbal cues that tend to precede criminal acts. Thus, even tweeting that you don't like your yoghurt might bring police to your door, especially if someone who tweeted the same thing three years before ended up shooting someone in the face later in the day.</p><p>However, unlike Facebook, neither police nor outside companies see the whole picture of what users do on social media platforms: private communications and "silent" actions – clicking links and opening pages – are invisible to them. But Facebook, Twitter, Google and similar companies surely know all of this – so their predictive power is much greater than the police's. They can even rank users based on how likely they are to commit certain acts.</p><p>An apt illustration of how such a system can be abused comes from <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9405.html" title=""><em>The Silicon Jungle</em></a>, ostensibly a work of fiction written by a Google data-mining engineer and published by Princeton University Press – not usually a fiction publisher – in 2010. The novel is set in the data-mining operation of Ubatoo – a search engine that bears a striking resemblance to Google – where a summer intern develops Terrorist-o-Meter, a sort of universal score of terrorism aptitude that the company could assign to all its users. Those unhappy with their scores would, of course, get a chance to correct them – by submitting even more details about themselves. This might seem like a crazy idea but – in perhaps another allusion to Google – Ubatoo's corporate culture is so obsessed with innovation that its interns are allowed to roam free, so the project goes ahead.</p><p>To build Terrorist-o-Meter, the intern takes a list of "interesting" books that indicate a potential interest in subversive activities and looks up the names of the customers who have bought them from one of Ubatoo's online shops. Then he finds the websites that those customers frequent and uses the URLs to find even more people – and so on until he hits the magic number of 5,000. The intern soon finds himself pursued by both an al-Qaida-like terrorist group that wants those 5,000 names to boost its recruitment campaign, as well as various defence and intelligence agencies that can't wait to preemptively ship those 5,000 people to Guantánamo.</p><p>We don't know if Facebook has some kind of Paedophile-o-Meter. But, given the extensive user analysis it already does, it probably wouldn't be very hard to build one –and not just for scoring paedophiles. What about Drug-o-Meter? Or – Joseph McCarthy would love this – Communist-o-Meter? Given enough data and the right algorithms, all of us are bound to look suspicious. What happens, then, when Facebook turns us – before we have committed any crimes – over to the police? Will we, like characters in a Kafka novel, struggle to understand what our crime really is and spend the rest of our lives clearing our names? Will Facebook perhaps also offer us a way to pay a fee to have our reputations restored? What if its algorithms are wrong?</p><p>The promise of predictive policing might be real, but so are its dangers. The solutionist impulse needs to be restrained. Police need to subject their algorithms to external scrutiny and address their biases. Social networking sites need to establish clear standards for how much predictive self-policing they'll actually do and how far they will go in profiling their users and sharing this data with police. While Facebook might be more effective than police in predicting crime, it cannot be allowed to take on these policing functions without also adhering to the same rules and regulations that spell out what police can and cannot do in a democracy. We cannot circumvent legal procedures and subvert democratic norms in the name of efficiency alone.</p><p></p><p><em>This is an edited extract from To Save Everything, Click Here: Technology, Solutionism, and the Urge to Fix Problems that Don't Exist by Evgeny Morozov, published by Allen Lane. </em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/big-data">Big data</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/computingandthenet">Computing and the net</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police">Police</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google">Google</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/amazon">Amazon.com</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cybercrime">Cybercrime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime">US crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime">Crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/software">Software</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/evgeny-morozov">Evgeny Morozov</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So far, information provided to the helpline has led to the arrests of 21 far-right EDL supporters, with more than 40 incidents reported against EDL leader Tommy Robinson alone.</p><p>Members of the BNP or EDL were involved in 54% of all incidents, of which three-quarters were committed by men. The average age of perpetrators were between 21 and 30.</p><p>The results follow a report by think-tank Chatham House which identified a considerable Islamophobic sentiment in the UK, detecting a "wide reservoir of public sympathy for claims that Islam and the growth of settled, Muslim communities pose a fundamental threat to the native group and nation."</p><p>The majority of incidents received by the helpline related to what it described as "abusive behaviour" with 74% of recorded incidents occurring online. However, experts agree that even non-violent incidents have a profound adverse impact on peoples' lives.</p><p>Fiyaz Mughal, co-ordinator of Tell MAMA and director of non-profit group Faith Matters said he was "shocked" by the amount of racial hatred they had detected in their first year of monitoring, particularly online.</p><p>Mughal, a former advisor to the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, added: "We are calling on police and politicians to do more to tackle this shameful wave of fear and prejudice. From the internet, to the workplace, the street and even houses of worship, too often Muslim women and men are becoming the target of vicious, sometimes violent, abuse.</p><p>He added: "Recent history shows us what happens if we allow our fears to run unchecked. Demonisation of 'the other', misguided beliefs that Muslims are somehow a monolithic block, unchecked lies that Islam is a violent religion or that British Muslims wish to abuse white girls must be challenged."</p><p>He is now calling on police forces to drastically improve their recording of Islamophobic crimes. At the moment just two forces, the Metropolitan police and City of London police, currently record anti-Muslim crimes separately. Mughal also wants the Home Office to take over monitoring of online hate and far-right groups from the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p><p>Other areas that the Muslim community believe could be improved include more prosecutions against online-based hatred.</p><p>"The police frequently fail to take victim statements, fail to appreciate the terrifying effects of these incidents upon women and vulnerable children. Few police forces even bother to record Islamophobia as part of their reporting systems. More training is needed at a time when police are facing budget cuts; we need more leadership too from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which, unhelpfully, has talked about fewer rather than more social media prosecutions," added Mughal.</p><p>During 2011 2,000 hate crimes were recorded against different faiths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by police with officers at the time admitting that they were unclear how many were against Muslims because separate figures were not recorded.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime">Crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam">Islam</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/far-right">The far right</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sayeeda-warsi">Sayeeda Warsi</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktownsend">Mark Townsend</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

group claimed it has killed seven kidnapped foreign construction workers, including one Briton.</p><p>Ansaru kidnapped seven employees of the Lebanese construction company Setraco a week ago. Three of the workers were Lebanese, while the other four were from Britain, Greece, Italy and the Philippines.</p><p>A message was posted on an Islamist website on Saturday that claimed Ansaru members killed the hostages after journalists saw British warplanes in Bauchi, northern Nigeria.</p><p>"As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed," the group said in the statement. It said a video of the killings would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting appeared to show a gunman standing over dead bodies.</p><p>The Foreign Office said it was urgently investigating the claims.</p><p>Ansaru previously issued a short statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners on 16 February from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about 125 miles north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state.</p><p>During the operation gunmen attacked a local prison and burned police trucks, authorities said. They then blew up a back fence at the construction firm's compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and police said.</p><p>The gunmen appeared to be organised and knew who they wanted to target, abducting the foreigners quickly while leaving the Nigerian household staff members unharmed, a witness said.</p><p>In January 2013, Ansaru declared itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main terrorist group, analysts have said. Boko Haram, which means "western education is sacrilege", has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. It has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an Associated Press count.</p><p>Britain previously linked Ansaru to the May 2011 kidnapping of Christopher McManus, who was abducted with Italian Franco Lamolinara from a home in Kebbi state. The men were held for months before their captors killed them in March 2012 during a failed Nigerian military raid backed up by British special forces in Sokoto, the main city in north-west Nigeria.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria">Nigeria</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa">Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Kenyans waited for nearly a week for its beleaguered electoral body, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, to announce the result. So far protests have remained peaceful in a country known for ethnic violence.</p><p>"This is a coming of age for Kenya," Kenyatta said in his acceptance speech. "Despite the misgivings of many in the world, we have demonstrated a level of political maturity that surpassed expectation. We voted in peace, we upheld order and respect for the rule of law, and maintained the fabric of our society."</p><p>Kenyan media called the election for Kenyatta before dawn after the electoral commission posted results from the last constituencies, but did not officially crown Kenyatta the winner until early afternoon. In the dawn hours, Kenyatta supporters blew whistles and vuvuzelas in celebration.</p><p>Boniface Mwinde, 25, is a bus conductor and Kenyatta supporter who went out to celebrate at three in the morning. "I feel very, very good," he said, wrapping himself in a red flag of Kenyatta's party. "I've been waiting to go back to work." Businesses and schools were closed across Nairobi during the long wait.</p><p>A Kenyatta presidency has worried western governments, which may have to limit diplomatic contact with Kenya due to the international criminal court charges against him. Kenya is an ally of the west in combating terror in Africa, and Nairobi, the capital, is home to a UN headquarters.</p><p>John Kerry, the US secretary of state, released a statement after the election saying America would remain "a strong friend and ally of the Kenyan people", but outgoing assistant secretary of state for Africa Johnnie Carson had previously warned of "consequences" for Kenya's government with Kenyatta in office.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Kenyatta told the international community that he would work with the ICC prosecution. "To the nations of the world I give you my assurance that ... we will continue to co-operate with all nations and institutions," he said.</p><p>"However," he added, "we also expect that the international community will respect the sovereignty and the democratic rule of Kenya." Kenyatta has called the ICC charges western meddling in Kenyan affairs.</p><p>Kenya's last general elections in 2007 were racked by ethnic violence that killed more than 1,200 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless after disputes over election results. This time Kenyans mobilised against violence with rallies, concerts and online campaigns. Last Monday's vote earned international praise as peaceful and fair.</p><p>But electronic glitches and lack of transparency tarnished the vote counting process, stretching the process over six days. Odinga's Coalition for Reforms and Democracy party accused the electoral commission of permitting vote-rigging, and a coalition of civil society groups filed a case against the electoral commission asking for a halt in the release of results, although this was dismissed. Tensions mounted as the long counting process tested Kenyans' patience.</p><p></p><p>When official results gave Kenyatta the presidency, Odinga urged his supporters to remain peaceful despite losing. "Let the supreme court determine whether the result determined by the [Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission] is the correct one. Any violence now will destroy this nation forever." Overall, peace held throughout the country, though there were reports of police in the western city of Kisumu dispersing small riots with tear gas and some rock throwing in the Nairobi slum of Kibera.</p><p>Odinga alleged "massive tampering of the tallying process," and vowed to go to the Kenyan supreme court for redress. "Democracy is on trial in Kenya," said Odinga. "It is clear that the process of electing a new set of leaders has been thwarted by another tainted election." The case will begin tomorrow, and could lead to another lengthy wait for Kenyans.</p><p>But Josh Ogure, an electrician in Kibera who supported Odinga, was not excited about a court battle.

In Port Said, residents tried to block the canal and attacked the football stadium.</p><p>In an unrelated protest in Cairo, a man died of teargas inhalation during a confrontation between police and anti-government demonstrators.</p><p>The court in Cairo also announced verdicts on Saturday for the other 52 defendants in the case, with 24 being sentenced to jail, including two senior police officers who received 15 years. The remaining 28 were acquitted, including seven police officers.</p><p>Police in Port Said retreated to their stations, fearing for their lives after weeks of violent clashes with supporters of the local football team, al-Masry. More than 50 people have died and hundreds more have been injured in the Mediterranean city during protests against the trial over the past month.</p><p>The sentences, broadcast live on television, were met with howls of protest from Port Said residents. Many felt their friends had been convicted for nothing.</p><p>"Twenty-five years for someone helping to carry the dead outside the stadium," said Mohamed Ataya, a football fan describing the case of his friend, convicted on Saturday. "What we need now is to separate from the rest of the country," he said, voicing the sense of estrangement from the rest of Egypt that is felt by many in Port Said.</p><p>Hundreds gathered outside the local government headquarters after the verdict carrying flags that called for an independent republic of Port Said.</p><p>Residents said they felt scapegoated by both the verdict and the military curfew enforced in the city since violence erupted in January when the death sentences were first announced.</p><p>Some protesters dragged a donkey through the streets daubed with the words "Fuck Ahly" – a reference to the Cairo-based fans of al-Ahly FC, whom al-Masry supporters claim were favoured in Saturday's verdict. Many in Port Said feel those sentenced to death were framed by police whom they believed favoured the al-Ahly fans.</p><p>But in Cairo, al-Ahly fans were also angered by the verdict. They initially set off fireworks in celebration that more Port Said supporters had been convicted. But sourness set in as they realised that only two of the nine police officers had been convicted.</p><p>In both Cairo and Port Said, many believe the February 2012 riots, in which 74 people were killed, were provoked by police. They began after al-Masry fans invaded the pitch and attacked al-Ahly supporters during a match between the two teams. Police stepped back from the trouble and turned off the stadium's electricity. In the darkness, fans were crushed at locked doors.</p><p>On Friday, two protesters were buried in back-to-back funerals after allegedly being shot by police. There are multiple reports from human rights activists and local campaigners of police firing indiscriminately at Port Said residents over the past few weeks.</p><p>But police holed up in the al-Sharq police station denied responsibility, blaming the deaths on criminals taking advantage of the chaos. "There are a lot of thugs beside the demonstrators," said Mohamed el-Adawy, the station's deputy commander. "Maybe they shot them by accident."</p><p>The case has highlighted worsening law and order in much of Egypt since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown two years ago.</p><p>The government of President Mohamed Morsi is struggling to halt the slide in security, hampered by a strike by some police in protests that are likely to be further fuelled by Saturday's jail sentences for the senior officers.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/egypt">Egypt</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa">Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/alahly">Al Ahly</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrick-kingsley">Patrick Kingsley</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was about 6 miles south of the village of Jamla where they had been held since being captured on Wednesday.</p><p>"They are all on the Jordanian side now and they are in good health," said Abu Mahmoud, a rebel who said he had gone into Jordan with them.</p><p>In Damascus, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/mar/09/un-peacekeepers-hostage-syrian-released-video">Mokhtar Lamani</a>, a representative of the UN-Arab League mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi, confirmed that the men had entered Jordan.</p><p>The group was part of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) that has been monitoring a ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights since 1974. After their capture insurgents described them as "guests" and said they would be freed once President Bashar al-Assad's forces withdrew from around Jamla and stopped shelling the area.</p><p>A brief truce was agreed on Saturday morning to allow for the peacekeepers' safe passage. Although the two-hour ceasefire ended at midday, before the men could be moved, the relative calm prevailed long enough for them to be taken south to Jordan.</p><p>A rescue attempt on Friday was delayed by heavy bombardment and abandoned after nightfall, the UN peacekeeping chief, Hervé Ladsous, said.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria">Syria</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations">United Nations</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We recognise and accept our international obligations and we will continue to co-operate with all nations and international institutions – in line with those obligations," he said.</p><p>Kenyatta, the current deputy prime minister and the son of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, won 50.07% of the vote, just enough to avoid a second round against Odinga.</p><p>Both sides relied heavily on their ethnic groups in a nation where tribal loyalties outweigh ideology at the ballot box. Kenyatta is a Kikuyu, the biggest of Kenya's many tribes; Odinga is a Luo. Both had running-mates from other tribes.</p><p>John Githongo, a former senior government official turned whistleblower, urged the rival coalitions, Odinga's CORD and Kenyatta's Jubilee, to ensure calm. "Jubilee and CORD, what you and your supporters say now determines continued peace and stability in Kenya. We are watching you!" <a href="https://twitter.com/johngithongo/status/309007127517724672" title="">he said on Twitter</a>.</p><p>From the early hours of Saturday after provisional results emerged, Kenyatta's joyous supporters thronged the streets of Nairobi and his tribal strongholds, lighting fluorescent flares and waving tree branches and chanting: "Uhuru, Uhuru".</p><p>But tensions rose in the heartlands of Odinga, "No Raila, no peace," Odinga supporters chanted as security forces fired teargas at crowds in Kisumu, a city where violence flared in 2007.</p><p>Diplomats believe that Kenyatta must co-operate with The Hague to ensure smooth international relations. "It won't be a headache as long as he co-operates with the ICC," said one western diplomat. "We respect the decision of the majority of the Kenyan voters."</p><p>Kenyans hope this vote, which has until now passed off with only pockets of unrest on voting day, will restore their nation's reputation as one of Africa's most stable democracies after killings last time left more than 1,200 dead.</p><p>Many Kenyans have said they are determined to avoid a repeat of the post-2007 chaos that brought the economy to a halt. Church leaders in Kisumu, in the west of Kenya that was devastated five years ago, sought to defuse tension this time.</p><p>"Our vote was stolen and we're angry," said Denis Onyango, a 28-year-old mechanic, as hundreds of supporter gathered with members of the security forces nearby. "Why did they bring such huge security here if the vote was to be free and fair?"</p><p>But some in the city accepted the outcome, more confident this time round that Kenya's institutions had ensured a fair vote. "I urge our candidate to forget the presidency and let the will of God prevail," said Diana Ndonga, a cloth vendor.</p><p>Many shops stayed closed as a precaution in the port city of Mombasa, another Odinga stronghold, but streets were calm.</p><p>"We are heading for a bleak future where the economy goes down and international relation sour because of the ICC case," said Athumani Yeya, 45, a teacher in the city.</p><p>But some were hopeful that Kenyatta could bring change. "We are celebrating. Even with the ICC case in Holland, the people of Kenya still have faith in him," said Thomas Gitau, 25, a barefoot car washer on a main Mombasa street. "We hope he can fix infrastructure and security so we have more jobs."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kenya">Kenya</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa">Africa</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

More than a tenth had been replaced in their jobs by the person who had covered their maternity leave.</p><p>Samantha Mangwana, an employment lawyer at Slater & Gordon, the law firm which commissioned the research, said the results were "sad and shocking".</p><p>"Women are suffering in silence," she said. "A common case is that a woman goes back to her role and all her clients have been given to other people. And they are not returned. So everything she has built up over the years is gone. Or they are simply being made redundant ahead of worse-performing men. The big issue is that women are somehow seen as being less committed to their employers because they are now mothers. Many companies are settling out of court because they don't want to be seen to be treating pregnant women or new mothers like this. But the awful thing is that I see the same major companies again and again and again, writing out these cheques – accompanied, of course, with a confidentiality clause."</p><p>Research company OnePoll questioned 1,000 women last month. On returning to their jobs, almost a third of the new mothers (30%) felt they didn't fit in any more and two in five felt they lacked support, with almost 20% feeling that no one understood what it was like juggling work with new motherhood. Nearly one in 10 said the stress affected their relationship with their partner. Only 3% had sought legal advice over maternity discrimination; 10% had sought help from their HR department.</p><p>It is unlawful to dismiss or otherwise disadvantage an employee for a reason related to her pregnancy or maternity leave. Campaign group <a href="http://www.maternityaction.org.uk/alliancepregnancydiscrim.html" title="">Maternity Action</a> provides advice to women and is trying to get the government to monitor unlawful discrimination. Before the recession, the Equal Opportunities Commission estimated that 30,000 women lost their jobs each year as a result of being pregnant, and campaigners believe that figure has risen dramatically.</p><p>"Those walking into Slater & Gordon are the tip of the iceberg," said Rosalind Bragg, director of <a href="http://www.maternityaction.org.uk/" title="">Maternity Action</a>. "We know there's a huge amount of pregnancy discrimination among low earners, who would not be able to go into a legal office for help. Demand for our helpline has doubled year on year for the past three years and our information sheets were downloaded 397,000 times.</p><p>Few cases go all the way to tribunal and when they do they attract a lot of publicity, like the case last month of Katie Tantum, 33, a trainee solicitor who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination, saying they "just stopped bothering" with her when they discovered she was pregnant. A judgment has yet to be reached with the firm claiming it was her "intellectual vigour" at fault.</p><p>Bragg said: "We believe only a very small percentage of women take any action against an employer who has broken the law. They may simply not know their rights, but often there will have been a period of bullying and harassment before the woman is finally sacked or leaves, so she's in no position to invest energy and emotion, let alone money, in pursuing an action that may well not produce results."</p><p>She pointed to comments made in 2011 by Downing Street's then director of strategy, Steve Hilton, who suggested that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jul/28/steve-hilton-policies-coalition-split" title="">scrapping all maternity allowances at work would help the economy</a>. "People might have backed away from his comments afterwards, but that message was already out there loud and clear." She added: "This year employment tribunal fees are to be introduced: an upfront fee of £1,200 before you even start, which is just increasing barriers. We expect the situation to get a lot worse."</p><p>One woman who contacted Maternity Action was Sarah, from the south-east. She wrote: "I was both anxious and excited about going back to work … I'd agonised over childcare and paid a large deposit at our local nursery. I'd left my son there for two weeks to get him used to it gradually. I had to buy new clothes as none of my old ones fitted any more … Like many women, I felt unconfident about going back – but also exhilarated.

Searches at two houses and a business began on Thursday, while a search of a third property was continuing, Scotland Yard said.</p><p>The Special Immigration Appeals Commission was due to hold an urgent telephone hearing on Saturday afternoon to determine whether Abu Qatada would be granted bail, a spokesman for the Judicial Office said.</p><p>No arrests have been made in connection with the police investigation.</p><p>A Home Office spokesman said: "The UK Border Agency arrested a 52-year-old man from north London for alleged breaches of his bail conditions imposed by the special immigration appeals commission (Siac)." He said the breach would be considered by Siac as soon as possible.</p><p>A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: "Searches at a residential address in north-west London, a residential address in west London and a business address in north-west London have been completed. A search at a residential address in north-west London is ongoing."</p><p>The searches were carried out in connection with ongoing inquiries by the counter-terrorism command, he said.</p><p>Abu Qatada, who has been convicted of terrorism charges in Jordan, was due to appear at the court of appeal on Monday as part of efforts by the home secretary, Theresa May, to overturn a judge's decision to allow him to stay in the UK.</p><p>Police raids on Abu Qatada's home began at 6.30am on Thursday, Scotland Yard said, and were followed by his arrest by the UKBA on Friday.</p><p>Once described by a Spanish judge as "Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe", Abu Qatada has fought deportation for more than a decade. Siac decided in November that he could not lawfully be deported to Jordan, where he was convicted of terrorism charges in his absence in 1999. Three Siac judges ruled there was a danger that evidence from Abu Qatada's former co-defendants, Abu Hawsher and Al-Hamasher, said to have been obtained by torture, could be used against him in a retrial in Jordan.</p><p>He was granted bail following the ruling, released from Long Lartin prison and returned to his family home in London.</p><p>On Monday the government will challenge the decision in front of three appeal court judges led by Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abu-qatada">Abu Qatada</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/uksecurity">UK security and terrorism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london">London</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

School boards must get approval from local police, and sentinels would have to be trained carry weapons in the schools. District residents could put the issue to a referendum.</p><p>Friday's vote in South Dakota follows a proposal in Georgia to extend the right to carry arms. The Republican-led state house voted 117-56 on Thursday to allow licensed gun owners to take weapons inside some unsecured government buildings where they are currently banned, starting on July 1. They would still be outlawed from college dormitories and sporting events.</p><p>The Democratic state representative Karla Drenner, who opposed the measure, said it was part of a backlash against a national push to strengthen gun control laws after the murder of 26 children and adults in Connecticut.</p><p>Drenner, an instructor at several colleges, said she was concerned about the impact on potential confrontations with angry students, recalling on Friday how a student once screamed at her for mispronouncing his name.</p><p>"If he had a gun, the outcome could have been much different," Drenner said.</p><p>In more liberal states with large urban centres such as New York and California politicians have been introducing more stringent gun control laws, but more conservative rural areas have been going in the opposite direction.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-dakota">South Dakota</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/state-of-georgia">State of Georgia</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control">US gun control</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We have a long way to go to hold onto the seats we gained last time, let alone pick up many more. But things are slightly less grim than the headline polls suggest, and we have everything to play for."</p><p>The Tory planning minister, Nick Boles, said on Friday night that the party had "screwed up" in the Eastleigh byelection but warned that it must not swing to the right after the drubbing.</p><p>He suggested the party had failed to offer voters any hope and had repeated the same mistakes it has been making for more than a decade.</p><p>The Times reported that it had seen details of a poll of Tory supporters that showed just 7% believed Cameron will win an overall majority at the next general election, while three-quarters expect Labour to be in power.</p><p>Boles told the Times that last week's Hampshire by-election, which saw the Tories pushed into third place behind Ukip, had been a "truly rotten campaign".</p><p>He said: "Where was the hope? It was as if modernisation had never happened.</p><p>"We screwed it up. We didn't even screw up in a new way. We screwed it up in an old way that we have been doing for a decade. It's so frustrating."</p><p>But Boles, an ally of the prime minister, warned plotters they needed "their head seeing to" if they believed it was wise to attempt to oust Cameron.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour">Labour</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservativehome">ConservativeHome</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservative-and-liberal-democrat-cabinet">Conservative and Liberal Democrat cabinet</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition">Liberal-Conservative coalition</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/lord-ashcroft">Lord Ashcroft</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron">David Cameron</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
