<p>At what will be her first public appearance since leaving the hospital where she was treated for gastroenteritis, the Queen will sign a new Commonwealth Charter, and will make an address explaining her commitment to it.</p>
<p>During the live television broadcast, Queen Elizabeth II, will, in what is being described as a &#8220;watershed&#8221; moment, signal her support for gay rights, a well as gender equality, and the charter which aims to boost human rights across the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The charter reads: &#8220;We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;other grounds&#8221; clause in the charter is intended to refer to sexuality, however specific references to gay and lesbian people were omitted due to some Commonwealth countries with anti-gay laws, reports the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>The Queen is expected to refer to rights which must &#8220;include everyone&#8221;, and insiders are noting the appearance as a nod to inclusivity.</p>
<p>A diplomatic source said: &#8220;<span style="line-height: 19px;">The impact of this statement on gay and women’s rights should not be underestimated. Nothing this progressive has ever been approved by the United Nations. And it is most unusual for the Queen to request to sign documents in public, never mind call the cameras in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace, said: &#8220;<span style="line-height: 19px;">In this charter, the Queen is endorsing a decision taken by the Commonwealth.&#8221; But he added: &#8220;The Queen does not take a personal view on these issues. The Queen’s position is apolitical, as it is on all matters of this sort.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Prior to tomorrow&#8217;s appearance, the Queen has been in talks with Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma, who has led the initiative. Last month, he said: &#8220;<span style="line-height: 19px;">We oppose discrimination or stigmatisation on any grounds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Royal aides have also been in discussion with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who has backed the drive for better gay rights, and gender equality.</p>
<p>Gay rights advocates have voiced strong opinions in the past, on the fact that the Queen is a patron of over 600 charities, however none of them are for gay rights. Queen Elizabeth II has never publicly voiced her support of equal rights for gay people.</p>
<p>Ben Summerskill of Stonewall, said the Queen had taken &#8220;an historic step forward&#8221; on gay rights, and said &#8220;The Palace has finally caught up with public opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said it was significant that the Queen was publicly acknowledging &#8220;the importance of the six per cent of her subjects who are gay. Some of the worst persecution of gay people in the world takes place in Commonwealth countries as a result of the British Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welsh Conservative MP David Davies said: &#8220;I fail to see why the Queen needs to make a special statement on this country’s opposition to discrimination against gays and women. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;My worry is the politically correct brigade will use it to silence legitimate debate about issues like gay marriage. One can’t help wondering what Prince Philip’s view would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davies, who recently<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/09/conservative-mp-most-parents-would-prefer-their-children-not-to-be-gay/"> suggested most parents would prefer their children “not to be gay”,</a> dismissed accusations that he is a homophobe by<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/10/david-davies-mp-how-can-i-be-homophobic-i-once-fought-a-gay-man-in-a-boxing-ring/"> reminding people of his participation in an amateur boxing match against a gay fighter.</a></p>
<p>Homosexual acts are illegal in 41 of the 54 Commonwealth nations, and penalties include the death sentence in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan, 25 years in jail in Trinidad and Tobego, 20 years plus flogging in Malaysia and life imprisonment in Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh and Guyana.</p>
<p>Only five Commonwealth countries recognise same-sex relationships: the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>
<p>The charter, to be signed at London&#8217;s Marlborough House, Pall Mall, is not directly linked to the issue of accession, the Queen&#8217;s acceptance of it could signal a change in Royal accession rights for males and females.</p>
<p>Before making her address, the Queen will celebrate the charter in a service at Westminster Abbey, where she will be joined by singer Beverly Knight, rock band the Noisettes and Sir Richard Branson.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/03/20/beverly-knight-hits-out-against-homophobia-in-black-music/">Beverly Knight has in the past spoken out against the blatant homophobia in a great deal of music from black artists including Beenie Man.</a></p>

<p>Zareh Sinanyan has been booked to speak before the Glendale City Council on Tuesday, in response to accusations of homophobic and racist comments online , reports <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_22752518/web-slurs-linked-candidate-glendale-city-council?" target="_blank">Daily News.</a></p>
<p>He is due to speak before the council after, on 5 March, Councilwoman Laura Friedman noted the accusations, pointing towards &#8220;extremely disturbing&#8221; comments allegedly posted by Sinanyan.</p>
<p>During the council meeting, Friedman said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t bring this up if this was not a very long series of posts around the Internet on blog sites, on YouTube, that are extremely disturbing, that are racist, homophobic, misogynist, threatening and really beyond something that we as a city can afford to have associated with one of our commissioners.&#8221;</p>
<p>A user named Zareh Sinanyan, had been posting comments on Youtube, as well as other websites, including homophobic, Islamophobic and racist views, up until around five years ago, according to an email sent to at least three City Council members.</p>
<p>The allegations arose after a Glendale Blog, sent screenshots of the comments to the council.</p>
<p>Some of the comments were posted in response to other users, however a Facebook comment from September 2012, allegedly left by the City Council hopeful, on the Armenian National Committee of America included a racial slur against mongolians.</p>
<p>Another reads: &#8220;Fuck you, fucking faggot.  Name the place bitch. Tell me where you are and I will be happy to meet you and shove a big tennis racquet up your vratsi ass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the original comments had been removed from Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>Both Friedman and Councilman Ara Najarian had moved to have the City Council consider taking the accused off the city Community Development Block Grant Advisory Committee at Tuesday&#8217;s meeting.</p>
<p>In an election on 2 April, both Najarian and Friedman are seeking re-election, and are among 12 candidates, including Sinanyan, running for three seats.</p>
<p>Sinanyan was appointed to the committee in November 2009 by Najarian and he served as chairman between 2009 and 2011.</p>
<p>Friedman and Najarian declined to comment on the case ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s meeting. A spokesman for the council said that some people believed the comments were placed there as a &#8220;cruel hoax&#8221;.</p>
<p>Scott Lowe, a blogger who reported the images, said that it appeared the posts were made anonymously, but that when Sinanyan linked his YouTube and Google+ accounts, the site retroactively connected his name to all comments made prior. He said the comments were removed this week, as emails began circulating.</p>
<p>The agenda for Tuesday&#8217;s meeting read: &#8220;City staff has not verified and does not &#8211; and cannot &#8211; represent that these posts or any other posts were made by Mr. Sinanyan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The accused&#8217;s campaign director, Elen Asatryan, said: &#8220;Since the City Council has chosen to place this on its agenda, he will address those concerns on Tuesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several local leaders have pulled out from supporting Sinanyan, until it is proven that he did not write the comments. They include Representative Adam Schiff, Los Angeles mayoral candidate Eric Garcetti, and City Councilman Paul Krekorian.</p>
<p>Krekorian wrote to Sinanyan on Friday to say that he was withdrawing his support. He said: &#8221;While I very much hope that the facts will demonstrate that you have no connection to these vile comments, until such time I cannot even impliedly lend my support to intolerant viewpoints and language that are contrary to everything I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the campaign Facebook page for Sinanyan, his supporters have referred to these allegations as a &#8220;smear campaign&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately it has become a common practice in this town that if you cannot beat an individual and/or when you feel that you have no possible chance against a candidate of Zareh&#8217;s caliber, start spreading lies and rumors in order to distract people from the real issues,&#8221; posted Sam Manoukian, a current member of Glendale&#8217;s Civil Service Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you that we will diligently work to find out who is behind this smear campaign and hold them responsible for their actions.&#8221;</p>

Supreme Court Justice in the US has responded to a letter from a young girl which requested that the Supreme Court strike down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to help her lesbian parents.</p>
<p>11-year-old Cameron Myers Milne, of Wilson, received a letter from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, which did not comment on the upcoming court case on DOMA, but did encourage Myers Milne to keep aiming high.</p>
<p>“I know dreams can come true when you work hard to achieve them,” Sotomayor wrote. “I wish you the joy of dreaming big, working hard and succeeding in all that you do.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is due on 27 March to hear evidence around the case of the <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/23/video-barack-obama-rules-us-will-no-longer-defend-the-anti-gay-defense-of-marriage-act/">Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, passed under President Bill Clinton in 1996.</a></p>
<p>Milne wrote to all nine Supreme Court justices after she watched President Obama&#8217;s inauguration in January, for his second term, with her lesbian parents who got married in New York, reports the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Speaking at his inauguration, President Barack Obama made a<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/21/obamas-our-journey-is-not-complete-until-gay-people-are-given-equal-rights/"> speech which said “our journey is not complete” until equal rights for gay people is reached, and referred to the importance of the Stonewall riots in terms of moves towards equality.</a></p>
<p>On 26 March, the court will also take up the case of whether to overturn <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/05/update-3-victory-for-proposition-8-gay-marriage-banned-in-california/">Proposition 8, which in 2008 added a clause to the Californian constitution stating that marriage could only be recognised by the state if it were between a man and a woman, causing widespread controversy.</a></p>
<p>Former President Bill Clinton, wrote an impassioned letter to the Supreme Court earlier this week which said that, despite signing DOMA into law himself<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/08/bill-clinton-i-signed-it-but-now-the-defense-of-marriage-act-must-be-overturned/">, he thought it was time for it to be overturned. </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/09/us-illinois-republican-party-chairman-may-be-ousted-for-same-sex-marriage-support/">The Illinois Republican State Central Committee had been scheduled to meet today (Saturday) to vote on whether to oust chairman Pat Brady from his role, following his bucking the party line by supporting same-sex marriage.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/03/republican-chairman-it-is-time-for-people-to-support-marriage-equality/">In January Mr Brady said that same-sex marriage “honours the best conservative principles. It strengthens and reinforces a key Republican value – that the law should treat all citizens equally.”</a> He was justifying his backing of a bill to legalise same-sex marriage in Illinois.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-illinois-republicans-pat-brady-20130309,0,2910142.story?track=rss" target="_blank"> Chicago Tribune</a> reports that the committee has cancelled today&#8217;s meeting to discuss Mr Brady&#8217;s support, and has said in a statement: &#8220;We are sorry for the late notice but we wanted to give the chairman every opportunity to respond to our request that he be present in person or by telephone at this meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Mr Brady had given notice to the party that he would be away this weekend on vacation several weeks ago.</p>
<p>Sources within the Republican party said the committee had found it difficult to secure the 60% of the weighted vote they would need to oust Mr Brady, suggesting they had cancelled the meeting to prevent embarrassment.</p>
<p>There were also said to be those questioning whether the special meeting could take place under Illinois Republican party rules.</p>
<p>Mr Brady said of the special meeting that it enforced public perception that the Republican party is a group of “old white guys”, but said he would respect the decision of the committee.</p>
<p>Committeeman Jim Oberweiss backed calls for Mr Brady to be removed, saying: “When you start publicly lobbying against a plank in our state and national party platforms, without even discussing with or advising the board of directors, I think he’s gone too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Republicans were concerned that the meeting would deepen divides within the party and harm its public image.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the &#8216;Report on Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in the EU&#8217; will be voted on by MEPs. It was prepared by the Committee on Women&#8217;s Rights and Gender Equality to mark International Women&#8217;s Day, which fell on Friday 8 March.</p>
<p>Bloggers drew attention to the report after they noticed it includes an article calling for &#8220;a ban on all forms of pornography in the media&#8221;, including &#8220;the digital field&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report, if passed, would only act as a recommendation to EU states, and would not result in pornography being legally banned. However, EU reports are often used to gauge support for potential future laws.</p>
<p>Jacqui Hunt, director of Equality Now in London, told the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/08/eu-porn-ban_n_2835991.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> that the report&#8217;s recommendations would help &#8221;to build a truly equal and democratic society, where women and girls do not have to experience prejudice or fear physical and psychological abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, critics say the report is worded too broadly, as it does not distinguish between types of pornography.</p>
<p>There are also concerns that this could mark a new trend in draconian policing of the internet and, in the words of one blogger, &#8220;unacceptable political invasion of people’s bedrooms”.</p>
<p>MEP Christian Engstrom of Sweden&#8217;s Pirate Party wrote on his blog: &#8220;This is quite clearly yet another attempt to get the internet service providers to start policing what citizens do on the internet, not by legislation, but by &#8216;self-regulation&#8217;. This is something we have seen before in a number of different proposals, and which is one of the big threats against information freedom in our society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although I completely agree that eliminating outdated gender stereotypes in the EU is a worthwhile goal, I will be voting against this resolution next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Engstrom added that he had received 350 emails within a day of blogging on the subject, all calling on MEPs to vote against the report.</p>
<p>Fears that internet censorship is growing in Europe were heightened in February when it emerged that legislators in Iceland are drafting a ban on internet pornography which, if passed, would be the first of its kind in a Western democracy.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech campaigners and academics wrote to Iceland&#8217;s interior minister last week urging him to end the legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iceland is a liberal democratic state which should not serve as a role model for Internet censorship,&#8221; said the letter. It added that the ban on pornography &#8220;may create demand for an underground porn industry, unregulated and most certainly affiliated with other illegal activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>MEPs are said to be intending to amend the wording of the report on Tuesday, clarifying that the ban is specific to pornography in&nbsp;advertising.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/09/recommendation-to-ban-porn-discovered-in-upcoming-eu-report/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"87";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:99:"

<p>State Chairman Pat Brady learned on Friday that Republican party leaders would meet privately this Saturday to discuss his bucking of the party line on marriage equality, and to vote on whether he should be ousted from his role.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/03/republican-chairman-it-is-time-for-people-to-support-marriage-equality/">In January Mr Brady said that same-sex marriage “honours the best conservative principles. It strengthens and reinforces a key Republican value – that the law should treat all citizens equally.”</a></p>
<p>Mr Brady said of the special meeting that it enforced public perception that the Republican party is a group of &#8220;old white guys&#8221;, but said he would respect the decision of the committee.</p>
<p>State Central Committeeman Jim Oberweiss predicted that the special meeting would get the required three-fifths of committee support needed to vote Mr Brady out of the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you start publicly lobbying against a plank in our state and national party platforms, without even discussing with or advising the board of directors, I think he’s gone too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d have exactly the same reaction if suddenly Pat decided to talk about the merits of Obamacare,&#8221; Mr Oberweiss added.</p>
<p>The National Organisation for Marriage (NOM) organised a campaign to flood committee members with emails calling for Mr Brady to be ousted. <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/26/us-pro-marriage-equality-gop-lawmaker-dismisses-500000-threat-from-anti-gay-group/">In February NOM pledged to spend $500,000 (£329,000) to defeat any pro-equal marriage Republicans.</a></p>
<p>Former Republican Governor Jim Edgar, who is anti-marriage equality, said he felt Mr Brady had done &#8220;a thankless job&#8221;, and cautioned against ousting him from his role, saying the party would be damaged for firing a major figure over their personal view on a social issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re concerned about the future of the party, if this is how it&#8217;s perceived, &#8216;We got rid of him because he&#8217;s for same-sex marriage,&#8217; long term that could have a detrimental effect on the party,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In many ways Mr Brady&#8217;s support echoed that of the <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/10/05/david-cameron-urges-tories-to-back-gay-marriage/">British Prime Minister David Cameron who said “I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.”</a></p>
<p>Just like the Conservative back-benchers in the UK who oppose David Cameron’s support for equality, Republican politicians have condemned Mr Brady’s support.</p>
<p>“I was shocked,” Mr Oberweiss said: “Very surprised. Did not expect that and didn’t know why he would have done that.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/12/illinois-republican-party-chairman-refuses-to-resign-over-same-sex-marriage-support/">There were even calls from within the party for Mr Brady to resign, which he resisted.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/11/09/oscars-producer-steps-down-after-ugly-and-bigoted-gay-comment/">He has subsequently apologised profusely for using the homophobic slur, and released a statement saying that he was to step down from directing the event. </a></p>
<p>The Tower Heist director<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/02/16/brett-ratner-to-helm-pro-gay-film-campaign-for-glaad/"> later announced that he was to produce and direct a GLAAD video campaign to promote equality for gay and trans people.</a></p>
<p>GLAAD will present Ratner with the prestigious Ally award at the 24th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in New York on 16 March.</p>
<p>GLAAD president Herndon Graddick, released a statement regarding the award, and referred to Ratner&#8217;s support of Christine Quinn, an openly gay New York City mayoral candidate.</p>
<p>He said: &#8221;I’ve never worked with someone so willing to put the past behind and move forward to make a difference, whether by our campaign or by hosting a fundraiser in his home to help elect the first lesbian mayor of New York,</p>
<p>“This is an example of a man willing to put his ego aside and roll up his sleeves for LGBT,&#8221; Graddick continued. &#8220;I’m proud to have worked with him and I consider him a friend.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Brett Ratner was ever a homophobe,” said Graddick, only met Ratner after the controversy. “I think he said something stupid. Getting to know him has borne that out.”</p>

href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/06/comment-pinknews-founder-benjamin-cohens-radio-4-broadcast-is-not-blasphemous/" target="_blank">After my first article was published earlier this week </a>on PinkNews.co.uk advocating that<a href="http://soundcloud.com/benjamincohen/benjamin-cohens-bbc-radio-4" target="_blank"> Benjamin Cohen’s Lent Talk for BBC Radio 4</a> was in no way blasphemous, I was eager to listen to the broadcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/06/christian-institute-tonights-radio-4-easter-talk-by-pinknews-founder-benjamin-cohen-is-a-new-low-for-bbc/" target="_blank">The Christian Institute had also weighed into the argument, describing Benjamin’s forthcoming broadcast as a “new low.”</a></p>
<p>So after all this unintended publicity, I struggled to find evidence <a href="http://soundcloud.com/benjamincohen/benjamin-cohens-bbc-radio-4">within the broadcast</a> of the <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/04/pinknews-founder-labelled-as-blasphemous-for-bbc-radio-4-programme-likening-abandonment-of-christ-to-rejection-of-gays/">blasphemy to which Christian Concern alluded,</a> or indeed any evidence of the stench of moral corruption that a new low would suggest.</p>
<p>Indeed, the inflammatory remarks of these organisations represent no more than mischievous innuendo.</p>
<p>I loved the broadcast. I’ll tell you why.</p>
<p>At the outset, Benjamin Cohen made it clear that he was not a Christian, but a Jew, and therefore could not endorse the Trinity, of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he explained that as a Jew, he could not endorse Jesus as the Son of God. So, the listener knows at the outset they are not getting an unadulterated party political broadcast for the Christian party. Rather, they are getting the view of an unbiased outsider, looking into the window of their world and faith.</p>
<p>Benjamin also speaks movingly about his education at a Christian prep school, and how their nativities, with the wise men bringing gold, frankincense and myrrh were the most Jewish nativities you could ever imagine depicted.</p>
<p>What brought me great joy during this part of the broadcast was that there was no hint of division or separation in Benjamin’s voice.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there seemed to me equality and integration in Benjamin’s school, of Christians and Jews alike. So while it may not be a story of depicting the Son of God for all, it definitively has resonance and familiarity for people of faith, as well as those of none at all.</p>
<p>I see nothing blasphemous so far, nor anything that signifies a new low.</p>
<p>Benjamin also speaks movingly of his struggle in being Jewish in a predominantly Christian environment, more in a ritualistic way than a fierce, negative, ideological opposition. He struggled mainly with parts of the Christian Church like saying the Lord’s Prayer, which are not part of the doctrine of his faith.</p>
<p>This also partly alludes to struggles with being a gay Jew he alludes to. As I suggested in my first article, coming out is not easy, especially when coming out directly opposes the most Holy doctrine of your faith, in Benjamin’s case, the Torah. Benjamin suggests in his talk that Leviticus challenged him and his Jewish faith when it exhorted that “Man shall not lie with another man” as this would be considered an abomination.</p>
<p>For Benjamin, this contrasted with earlier jubilation he felt after the 25 hour fast of Yom Kippur. It was a testing time for him, he felt and he was extremely worried at the prospect of possible family abandonment.</p>
<p>I think all of us in the LGBT community have a fear of difference, and the possibility of damage to familial or other relationships that we hold dear in our hearts.</p>
<p>There is a cost to actions we take, and abandonment is one of them. The classic reaction, of course is to try and fit in with the norms and values of your given culture, as nobody wants to be seen as the outsider, or to effectively have the door slammed shut in your face.</p>
<p>Psychologically, we all need to belong to society in some ways.</p>
<p>Benjamin was especially worried, as although there are some Jewish scholars and Rabbis who believe that Leviticus refers to male rape, or scholars who believe that it is out of date and out of touch with modernity, there are a great many that also believe the Torah is the literal word of God and should be read as such.</p>
<p>I can empathise with Benjamin here, since prior to transition, my former stepfather told me I was a disappointment to him as a man. Now, he was emotionally abusive across the board anyway, but knowing I had failed a test in his eyes was like an emotional knife wound. I wanted to please him, please my mother and thus maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Since though, I am happy to report I have prospered.</p>
<p>Benjamin admits he was lucky, and his family supported him. This for me is a double edged sword, and not for the reason you might expect, that of jealousy.</p>
<p>I think it is sad, and a sad indictment on our 2013 modern society when one has to feel lucky to express their sexuality, but also, this could be argued to be a very Western viewpoint when you stop to consider that in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is still illegal, and punishable by torrid means.</p>
<p>I think everyone should be free to express their sexuality as they choose, and far from being a new low, it is conversely a complete high as one would hope that the end result would be a person feeling happy, content and whole.</p>
<p>The imagery of Jesus and the Crucifixion clearly figures highly on Benjamin’s mind, since the famous Biblical messianic text is quoted “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?”</p>
<p>It is a Messianic text as foretold in the Psalms.</p>
<p>All LGBT people, and to some extent all minority groups fear abandonment in relation to mere circumstance over which they have no control.</p>
<p>Therefore, our sense of utter catharsis when that abandonment does not occur is palpable, truly.</p>
<p>Lastly, Benjamin ends with the image of the crucifix with Jesus looking down upon him when he convenes meetings of his local gay Jewish group in his garden, as he lives next door to a Catholic church.</p>
<p>I think love is something all faiths can agree on as something vital and crucial to their creeds. I think all people can do similar.</p>
<p>But those who alleged blasphemy or suggested that depths of a new low had been plundered to me were left wanting in the extreme.</p>
<p>Like Jesus, and like his family, Benjamin’s message was one of love, and hope, especially for the young LGBT population. I applaud Radio 4 and the BBC for having the courage of its convictions, and broadcasting it in the face of protest.</p>
<p>I also applaud Benjamin for speaking out since I feel sure that he will have received condemnation from within his own Orthodox Jewish Community for speaking out so powerfully, and on a national platform.</p>
<p>In closing, I have a message for the naysayers. You said the broadcast was blasphemous, and a new low.</p>
<p>I say, your blasphemy is simple fear. Fear of change and the unknown, not to mention bigotry. I believe that a Conservative translation of the Bible is bigoted, and robs it, or indeed any other religious text of its beauty.</p>
<p>One has to accept that when they choose dogma over enlightenment, they become isolated.</p>
<p>I find the idea of a new low baffling. But you see, for organisations like Christian Concern and The Christian Institute every step towards inclusivity is a low. For it represents a diminution of their brand of Christianity, and makes them hypervigilant.</p>
<p>Their view of Christianity is monolithic. Mine is pluralistic. There is room for more than one view of Christian doctrine, or indeed any other faith’s doctrine.</p>
<p>The fact that through the medium of radio, this idea is being offered up for consideration via Benjamin Cohen and BBC Radio 4 should be celebrated.</p>
<p>As for new lows and blasphemy, they are not the fault of LGBT people. but the fault of perception, and the free choice all were given. Think about it.</p>

<p>Hospital staff became concerned when the 15 year old boy was brought in by his grandmother, with marks and cuts on his torso, hands, arms, and thighs.</p>
<p>It emerged that he had been beaten with an electrical cable by his mother, Erica Moore, after she found him engaged in oral sex with her 18 year old male cousin.</p>
<p>Moore said: &#8220;My cousin, at the time, he was 18. My son he was 15, and I had walked in the room on [my cousin] giving oral sex to my son and I started whooping my son, and I’m the one who got in trouble as a result of me whooping him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;It was just disgusting to me, the way he was looking and my cousin was looking, and my cousin immediately ran out the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police department told me that it was consensual, but they was committing a homosexual act in my house and we are totally against that. So I whooped my son and about three or four months later they came and arrested me for abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as justifying her actions based on her &#8220;disgust&#8221;, Moore said she had beaten her son because she had also been beaten that way as a child.</p>
<p>She added that she did not discriminate, as she would have done the same thing if she had caught her daughter in a similar position.</p>
<p>She said: “What do you do in a situation like that where I’m catching my son having sex? It would be no different than me catching my daughter and she had a boy in the house and me disciplining her for having a boy in the house.”</p>
<p>Moore is facing a Class-A misdemeanour assault charge, which has the potential to result in a jail sentence.</p>
<p>She remains adamant that she did not act wrongly, and claims that the police officer who charged her had said that, off the record, he would have done the same. This was denied by the Police Department.</p>
<p>Moore said: &#8220;Even that day when the police officer came out here, he told me out of his own mouth, ‘If it was me and I walked in on my child,’ he said, ‘parent to parent I probably would have shot him. I probably would have shot both of them.’ But with the law you can’t, you’re not allowed to put whoops on him. He said you can whoop him, but you’re not allowed to leave any marks on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Dan Dennis of the Forest Hill Police Department said that Moore had lied about the officer&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p><em><strong>He told CBS: &#8220;Miss Moore’s statement of the officer’s alleged inappropriate comments are simply untrue.  The conversation was recorded.  The officer’s conduct was entirely professional.  The Forest Hill Police Department does not discriminate against any citizen based on sexual orientation.&#8221;</strong></em></p>

<p>Officials at Oberlin College in the US state of Ohio say they have &#8220;significant concerns&#8221; about homophobic, racist and anti-Semitic graffiti that has turned up in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Campus residents began noticing the campaign of hate in early February. In one instance, a note was left in the Multicultural Resource Center that read “Nigger + Faggot Center.”</p>
<p>In the same month, a poster was defaced to say “Year of the Queer”.</p>
<p>Oberlin College was one of the first university’s in America to allow racial integration between white and black students.</p>
<p>Classes were cancelled on Monday 4 March after a report of someone wearing what looked like a Ku Klux Klan-type hooded robe on campus.</p>
<p>Oberlin College declared Monday &#8220;a Day of Solidarity&#8221; and President Marvin Krislov said in a statement:</p>
<p>“We hope today will allow the entire community — students, faculty, and staff — to make a strong statement about the values that we cherish here at Oberlin: inclusion, respect for others, and a strong and abiding faith in the worth of every individual. Indeed, the strength of Oberlin comes from our belief that diversity and openness enriches us all, and enhances the educational mission at its core.”</p>
<p>Campus Pride previously gave Oberlin 5-out-of-5 for&nbsp;gay-friendliness.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/08/fbi-investigates-gay-and-racist-hate-incidents-at-ohios-oberlin-college/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:75:"

<p><a style="line-height: 19px;" href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/08/16/more-details-emerge-in-gay-suicide-case/">The 18-year-old killed himself by jumping off a bridge in September 2010, just weeks into his first year at the university</a> after a gay romantic encounter was filmed and broadcast by his roommate.</p>
<p>Jane and Joseph Clementi have requested an apology from the National Organisation for Marriage after Jennifer Roback Morse, president of the National Organization for Marriage&#8217;s Ruth Institute, referred to Tyler&#8217;s suicide in a speech at Iowa State University.</p>
<p>She was speaking to a group of Catholic students at the university back in February, and encouraged them to encourage gay peers to discourage them from becoming sexually active.</p>
<p>&#8220;That kid Tyler Clementi who killed himself — who threw himself off the George Washington Bridge&#8221;, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, there was a much older man in the picture&#8230;And so I think friendship is what you have to offer. There are a lot of situations where people are doing something sexual that’s probably not the best thing for them and it would be better if they had somebody who&#8217;d be friends with them without coming on to them or without judging them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane and Joseph Clementi called Morse&#8217;s comments &#8220;ludicrous&#8221;, for linking their son&#8217;s suicide support from LGBT peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;To exploit our late son&#8217;s name to advance an anti-equality agenda is offensive and wrong,&#8221; the Clementis said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;By doing so, National Organization for Marriage proves that not only is there no low they will not sink to, to advance their cruel agenda — but that neither they nor Ms Morse have any grip on reality. The very idea that Tyler&#8217;s tragedy happened because of too much support — instead of not enough — is ludicrous. Shame on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as the Clementis called for the apology from NOM.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is among the more reprehensible tactics we&#8217;ve seen from NOM,&#8221; GLAAD President Herndon Graddick said in a statement. &#8220;They&#8217;re using Tyler&#8217;s story to pit young people against their own peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case of Tyler&#8217;s suicide attracted national attention in the US, including comment from President Obama, and prompted anti-bullying measures. Clementi, a Ridgewood native, committed suicide in September 2010 during his freshman year at Rutgers University after his roommate secretly recorded and broadcast his romantic encounter with another man in their dorm room.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/16/tyler-clementis-room-mate-found-guilty-on-all-counts/">Roommate Dharun Ravi was convicted last year of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and other counts and served less than a month in jail. He is now appealing his conviction.</a></p>

<p>Zimbabwe’s Herald Newspaper reports Mr Tsvangirai made the comments during a meeting this week in Harare, the country’s capital.</p>
<p>He is alleged to have said: “In the draft constitution, we said marriage is between a man and a woman and those who want to marry another from the same sex, then they have a problem. Why do you want to sleep with another man?”</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is to hold a referendum this Saturday on its draft constitution.</p>
<p>It explicitly bans same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>On Friday, Gay and Lesbian of Zimbabwe (GALZ) described Mr Tsvangirai’s comments as “reckless” and going against the inclusive legal spirit of the constitution.</p>
<p>In a statement it said: “GALZ is of the view that Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s statements fuel public prejudice against LGBTI individuals and contradict the very preamble of a draft constitution that he is seemingly promoting”.</p>
<p>It added: “The PM has been jolted into castigating violence in Headlands recently however we find him equally guilty of inciting violence and advocating hatred and hate speech on the LGBTI community in Zimbabwe.”</p>
<p>Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Zimbabwe and since 1995 the government has carried out campaigns against gay men and lesbians.</p>
<p>Robert Mugabe, president since 1987, has been a staunch promoter of homophobic persecution.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/02/27/robert-mugabe-attacks-gays-in-birthday-rant/">He marked his 88<sup>th</sup> birthday party in February 2012 by urging gay people to go to “hell” in a public speech.</a></p>
<p>President Mugabe has also said gay people are worse than “pigs and dogs”.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Morgan Tsvangirai appears to have done a U-turn on gay rights.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/10/24/zimbabwe-prime-ministers-says-gay-rights-are-human-rights/">Speaking to the BBC in October 2011, he said gay rights were a “human right” that should be respected by Zimbabweans and that “freedom of sexual orientation” should be protected in his country’s constitution.</a></p>
<p>However, Gay and Lesbian of Zimbabwe said his latest comments prove the PM has failed to “uphold his commitment to human rights and the acceptance of&nbsp;diversity.”</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/08/zimbabwean-pm-morgan-tsvangirai-accused-of-hate-speech-by-gay-rights-group/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:81:"

<p>In a series of previously unpublished notes, as part of the new Archbishop&#8217;s biography, he voices his opposition to equal adoption rights for gay couples, describes sexuality as a &#8220;powerful force&#8221; and says that the bible is &#8220;clear&#8221; that gay sex is wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/04/new-archbishop-of-canterbury-marriage-is-between-a-man-and-a-woman-and-always-has-been/">Justin Welby, 57, was confirmed as leader of the Church of England in a ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral on 4 February. He had previously served as the Bishop of Durham for two years.</a></p>
<p>In one article, Welby discusses former Tory Cabinet Minister Michael Portillo&#8217;s admission that he had &#8220;homosexual experiences&#8221; as a student.</p>
<p>Welby writes that it had no bearing on Portillo&#8217;s political career, but describes sexuality as a &#8220;powerful force&#8221; which can lead people &#8220;astray&#8221;, and writes: &#8220;The standards of expected sexual morality are clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the bible it is clear that the right place for sex is only within a committed heterosexual marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interestingly all recent research also shows that the children of such a relationship are likely (not always but often) to be happier and more stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then goes on to voice his opinion that it is possible for people to change their sexuality. In the case of Portillo, Welby criticised the media for &#8220;[talking] as though his sexuality is exactly the same now as then&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Archbishop voices his frustration at being branded a homophobic &#8220;European Taliban&#8221; for advocating for &#8220;traditional&#8221; views on sex.</p>
<p>In another of the letters, from 1999, Welby criticises the Church of England charity the Children&#8217;s Society, for its decision to lift its ban on placing children for adoption and fostering with gay couples.</p>
<p>He wrote of the parish laving to &#8220;review its decision to support them&#8221; in light of the change, as well as urging the charity to rethink its stance. It is now illegal for charities to discriminate against gay couples.</p>
<p>Another issue he addresses is Prince Harry taking marijuana. He wrote: “What a surprise, a teenager has too much to drink and tries cannabis&#8230; What is the world coming to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Criticising the media, he continued: “No doubt, no journalist drinks anything but water, and all have difficulty even spelling marijuana. Oh please!”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 19px;">The author of the biography, Reverend Dr Andrew Ahterstone, an Oxford Academic told the Telegraph: &#8221;He speaks his mind with wonderful frankness, unencumbered by nervous press officers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In other documents, he warns of a crisis for the Church of England due to financial pressure and dropping numbers, and even describes a &#8220;serious questions of viability&#8221; in the next ten years.</p>
<p>Welby, a former oil executive, will be formally enthroned in Canterbury later this month. Some critics have noted his apparent reluctance to be involved in the equal marriage debate since he was appointed Archbishop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/11/09/uk-new-archbishop-signals-openness-on-lgbt-issues/">The former Bishop of Durham, previously said the Church of England must have “no truck with any form of homophobia”.</a></p>
<p>Although Dr Welby has previously stated his opposition to equal marriage and the ordination of gay bishops, in a speech at Lambeth Palace, Dr Welby signalled that he was willing to engage on LGBT issues.</p>

<p>The figure shows support has risen 5% among Catholics since last December.</p>
<p>Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said: “Catholic voters are leading American voters toward support for same-sex marriage”.</p>
<p>Among all Americans, it’s a closer margin, with 47% supporting and 43% opposing equal marriage.</p>

<p>Mr Twigg went up against Ken Clark, Diane James, the UKIP candidate for the Eastleigh by-election, Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT union and Melanie Phillips, columnist.</p>
<p>Twitter users speculated that Mr Twigg may have accidentally drawn on his nose with a biro, or even that the mark might be cigarette ash, a twig, or some cake, however the real reason for the marking had been revealed in the Evening Standard the day before.</p>
<p>The Standard reported: &#8220;He had a boil on his proboscis and he applied cream and plaster all by himself&#8221;, reporting on the nose plaster he was wearing in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>The panel tackles issues such as the Catholic Church, the economy and immigration, however it was Mr Twigg&#8217;s nose which caused the furore, some viewers saying they couldn&#8217;t concentrate because of it, others saying they would raise their hand to ask him about it, if they were in the audience.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Andy Dowling ‏took to Twitter and said: &#8220;Stephen Twigg could be explaining the meaning of life on #bbcqt and I&#8217;d miss it cos I&#8217;m distracted by what&#8217;s goin on on the end of his nose.&#8221;</p>
<p>One microblogger Kris Milovsorov ‏jokingly said: “Stephen Twigg&#8217;s nose &#8211; scrapping the bottom of the policy barrel? #bbcqt #WHATISWRONGWITHHISNOSE?!”</p>
<p>Comedian Michael Moran said: “In HD Steven Twigg’s nose item is powerfully upsetting.”</p>
<p>While Keith Mackrell ‏asked: “Everyone should be watching question time even if it&#8217;s just to work out what&#8217;s on the end of Stephen twigg&#8217;s nose! #bbcqt #nosemystery&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benjamincohen" target="_blank">Benjamin Cohen</a>, founder of PinkNews tweeted the revelation that Mr Twigg had put a plaster on his nose after having a boil. He said: &#8220;If you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s on Stephen Twigg&#8217;s nose, it&#8217;s a plaster with cream underneath &#8211; read in@<b>EveningStandard</b> yesterday <s>#</s><b>BBCQT&#8221;.</b></p>
<p>One other user said it wasn&#8217;t only Mr Twigg&#8217;s plaster which was distracting her, but host David Dimbleby&#8217;s tie also. Alice Woolley, said: &#8220;I can’t concentrate at all because of Stephen Twigg’s nose and David Dimbleby’s tie. <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bbcqt&amp;src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s>bbcqt</a>&#8220;.</p>

<p>Mr Twigg, the shadow education secretary, was elected as the Labour MP for Enfield Southgate in 1997.</p>
<p>He took his seat in Liverpool West Derby from then defence secretary Michael Portillo, and despite the facial mark, tackled questions from attendees in Dover, last night.</p>
<p>During Question Time a parody Twitter account appeared, named @SteveTwiggsnose, and tweeted: &#8220;Finally! My moment in the sun! I&#8217;m famous, I tell you! Famous! <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bbcqt&amp;src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s><b>bbcqt</b></a>,&#8221; however the account had tweeted only nine times and had only four followers as of Friday.</p>

He claims that those who accused Mr Cohen of blasphemy are the real blasphemers.</p>
<p>The programme, broadcast on Wednesday as part of the network&#8217;s Lent Talks season, was criticised by Christian campaigners before it was even aired for including a segment on the Gospel’s description of Jesus’ abandonment by society “for something he couldn’t help”, something that Mr Cohen reflected is similar to fears of abandonment that many young LGBT experience before coming out.</p>
<p>In the programme, Mr Cohen criticised parents for rejecting their children saying: “In many cases, the reason for this rejection is religion – something that really angers and upsets me. Religion should be about bringing families together, united in devotion and celebration, not tearing them apart.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/06/christian-institute-tonights-radio-4-easter-talk-by-pinknews-founder-benjamin-cohen-is-a-new-low-for-bbc/">The Christian Institute described the broadcast as a &#8220;new low by the BBC&#8221; and a &#8220;slap in the face to every Christian&#8221;.</a></p>
<p>The Cranmer blog, written as if it were authored by the late Archbishop Cranmer, tells his deeply Christian readership: &#8220;Mr Cohen is also human &#8211; a sentient and deeply spiritual creature who eats bread, feels want, tastes grief and needs friends. Just like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His defence of Mr Cohen continued:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Nowhere in his talk does Benjamin Cohen defame Christ or denigrate the name of Jesus. One may quibble with his imperfect grasp of Christian theology, but His Grace is merely Anglican and so also utterly devoid of that perfect divine communion claimed by the theologically infallible. One could write a weighty dissertation on the question of whether or not Jesus had no choice but to die an agonising death on the cross &#8211; that is, &#8216;for something he couldn’t help&#8217;. But to dismiss the coincident feelings of a gay Jew as &#8216;blasphemy&#8217; is the real blasphemy. Jesus died for everyone: we are all sinners before the Throne of Grace. It is simply the feeling of helplessness in absence of choice in life&#8217;s course which Mr Cohen meditates upon.</p>
<p>And His Grace uses &#8216;meditates&#8217; purposefully. For it is a clear and deep reflection on the character and mission of Christ. Throughout his talk, Mr Cohen is respectful and reverent. Those who have leapt to judgment appear not have thought at all about the meaning of Christ to a gay Jew, preferring instead to cry &#8216;blasphemy&#8217; as their precious and pure Christ is, once again, dragged through the mud and filth of a contrary Christology.</p>
<p>Hanging on the cross, Jesus said: &#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” For Mr Cohen, this echoes something of the fear of abandonment experienced by gay people. And he isn&#8217;t entirely ignorant of his subject matter. He talks openly about the impact of being taught at an Anglican school that he, as a Jew, was responsible for the abandonment and crucifixion of Christ (..what a sensitive and intelligent RE teacher he must have had). He went on to study Theology at King’s College, University of London, and studied both the New Testament and the Torah. His final dissertation was on the Jinns of Islam in Morocco. His is not a voice of aggressive secularism: he is doing what all truly spiritual people do: making sense and finding meaning in the Messiah God-man who died that we might live.</p>
<p>Mr Cohen explains: &#8220;The only thing I directly criticise about Christianity and indeed any religion in my talk is that religion is often used as the basis for parents rejecting their LGBT children, something that I say is wrong and that it is terrible that this has in some cases led to young people committing suicide. I’m not sure what is blasphemous or offensive in this message at all.”</p>
<p>Quite. What kind of parent &#8211; what manner of Christian &#8211; rejects their child for being gay?</p>
<p>“Of course, I understand that for the very religious, it is difficult &#8211; an orthodox Jew really does believe the Torah is the literal word of God and a devout Catholic believes the Pope is infallible,” he says. “But do people of faith really want to reject their children for something which I believe they can&#8217;t help? Just as, the Jewish authorities rejected Christ &#8211; for something he considered he couldn&#8217;t help- being the son of God?”</p>
<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/benjamincohen/benjamin-cohens-bbc-radio-4" target="_blank">Before coming to judgment, LISTEN to the talk HERE.</a></p>
<p>You will hear Mr Cohen talk about the large crucifix on a neighbouring church which overlooks his garden, where he and his (gay) friends often gather. “Having feared such abandonment myself, every time I look up at Christ, I’m happy that both our stories are ultimately about embracing love, rather than fear,” he says.</p>
<p>To dismiss this as &#8216;blasphemy&#8217; is to misunderstand Christology, abuse theology, and defame the name of Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of His Grace&#8217;s readers are not so Christian when it comes to Mr Cohen&#8217;s broadcast.</p>
<p>One asked Mr Cohen: &#8220;When is it all going to stop Ben, this gay crusade?&#8221;, adding: &#8220;Let this man tell you this. He’s seen two men kiss and cuddle in the street. And do you know what this man had to do. He had to turn his head away, because it was quite the most revolting spectacle he’d seen in a city street. Believe him when he says this is a feeling any red blooded man will have. And the younger the man, the more intense it will be. In fact, you have to be pretty far down the road of personally degeneracy to feel otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;Stats on assault show that gays are more likely to be bullied and injured by other gays than by the 98% heterosexual population.&#8221;</p>
<p>One claimed that Mr Cohen wished everyone to be gay, claiming: &#8220;Don’t be fooled by Cohen, fellow commentators here. We do not have a man who wants society to be gay tolerant. We have a man who wants society to be gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cohen responded with his own comment: &#8220;To those that claimed that I wish society to be gay- Why would I want that? I have a business that only exists because LGBT people are a minority group. If everyone was gay as you claim, what would be the point of PinkNews? No, all I want is for same-sex couples to be treated with the respect and dignity of every other&nbsp;couple.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:145:"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/08/influential-christian-blogger-defends-pinknews-founder-benjamin-cohen-against-accusations-of-blasphamy/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"14";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:87:"

<p>With homosexuality a criminal offence in more than 76 countries around the world, the website is designed to make LGBT Americans more informed.</p>
<p>Under a quote from former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton of how “gay rights are human rights”, the guide gives general guidelines.</p>
<p>It says any travellers who run into problems should seek help at a US embassy or consulate, and that officials there will &#8220;not make generalisations, assumptions, or pass judgement.&#8221;</p>
<p>State Department advice includes: &#8220;If you intend to frequent Internet chat rooms or other meeting places, it’s wise to find out about the local situation – police in some countries have been known to monitor such sites and locales with the intention of carrying out entrapment campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avoid excessive physical displays of affection in public, particularly in more conservative countries or regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some resorts or LGBT neighborhoods can be quite segregated. Be aware that local residents may not approve of expressions of sexuality when you are in surrounding areas&#8221;.</p>
<p>The website also says: &#8221;some hotels, especially in rural areas, won’t accept bookings from same-sex couples. It’s best to check before you go.&#8221;</p>
