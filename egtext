Holly Madison has settled on a name for her newborn daughter - and it's very colourful indeed. 
 
The 33-year-old former Playboy model and her boyfriend, Pasquale Rotella, 38, have called the little girl Rainbow Aurora Rotella.
 
'I wanted to give my daughter a unique name,' she told E! on Friday.

'Growing up, there was a girl in my school named Rainbow and I was so envious of that name. I thought it was so pretty and unique' 
 
Holly, who previously dated Playboy mogul Hugh Hefner and starred in the reality show Girls Next Door, gave birth on Tuesday and the little girl tipped the scales at a healthy seven pounds and two ounces.
 
On Friday she also posted a message to her fans on her blog along with a picture of herself with her partner.

She wrote: 'Hi everyone! I just wanted to say thank you for all the wonderful messages you guys have been posting! I appreciate them all!
 
'I’ve been spending the last day or so learning how to be a mom— it’s the best project in the world! I never thought I would be so happy - especially on so little sleep!'
 
She looked happy and healthy in the snap as she cuddled up to her man, but decided not to include her daughter in the shot.
